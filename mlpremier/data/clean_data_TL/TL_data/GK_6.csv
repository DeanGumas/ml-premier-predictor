Not content to simply progress to the World Cup play-offs, Scotland decided they may as well secure a home semi-final by virtue of seeding. This victory over a previously imperious Denmark team on a special evening on Glasgows south side proved the fitting conclusion to a successful campaign for Steve Clarke and his team. Scotland have won six competitive games in a row for the first time since 1930. Their only frustration is associated with the wait until March for the first of two games Clarke hopes will return this international side to a World Cup after a wait stretching back to 1998. On this evidence, Scotland have nothing to fear. They rattled, harassed and outplayed Denmark. Everything came together, said Clarke. We were always on the front foot. It was a really good night for us. When I came into this job there was a lot of negativity around. Now theres a lot of positivity and the players love it. The players like to be loved and they feel the love of the crowd which is great. Clarkes team closed just four points behind the Danes in Group F. Seeding will render what comes next slightly easier, with Hampden Park in this raucous form quite the backdrop. The switch in public attitudes towards the Scotland team was demonstrated by the scarcity of available tickets for this encounter. Under Clarke, the upwardly mobile Scots have broken the mould of failed campaign after failed campaign. Following this team has become fashionable once more. It was typical of the managers approach that this fixture was deemed significant despite the play-off berth being secured days earlier in Moldova. Understandable Clarke focus also fell on officialdom. Five of the starting XI here  Stephen ODonnell, Billy Gilmour, John McGinn, Che Adams and Andy Robertson  would be suspended for the play-off semi final if collecting a yellow card. No Scotland players were booked as the Danes were swatted aside. Denmarks direct progress to Qatar was sealed long ago. They arrived in Glasgow seeking to complete the perfect 10 out of 10 qualifying wins. In the midst of their run was a comprehensive dismissal of Scotland in Copenhagen. After a bright Scottish start, the visitors served notice of their intentions via Daniel Wass. The Valencia midfielder, arriving late in the penalty area, bundled narrowly wide from Rasmus Kristensens cross. Scotland remained hugely competitive. Midway through the opening half, in concluding a sweeping move kept alive by the tenacity of Ryan Christie, Adams forced Kasper Schmeichel to a terrific save with an outstretched foot. The majority of Hampden was already on its feet to acclaim the opening goal. There began a concerted spell of Scotland pressure. Adams was denied a wonderful goal, following a break as included a spectacular Christie pass, by Simon Kjaers despairing block. Denmark were helpless, though, to prevent John Souttars opener. The Hearts defender, who has endured a horrible time with serious injury, delivered a moment of huge personal significance by nodding home from six yards. Liam Cooper had earlier headed McGinns corner perfectly into Souttars path. The 25-year-olds celebration supplied evidence of his earlier turmoil. Matters simmered down to a dull roar in the opening stages of the second half. Set pieces appeared Scotlands best hope of a crucial second, with Schmeichel looking surprisingly ill at ease under cross balls. Not that open play was completely ineffective; Gilmour tested the Leicester City custodian from long range before Adams cracked a post from a narrow angle. The Southampton forward, who was terrific all evening, was belatedly flagged offside but Tartan Army belief continued to rise. That Robertson, the Scotland captain, limped off with 11 minutes to play placed a minor dampener on the evening for the hosts. Smiles were soon returned to faces. The outstanding Adams stayed onside, ran onto Stuart Armstrongs through pass and slammed beyond Schmeichel. Hampden erupted. The Clarke-led revival of this scene deserves the most fulsome of praise.

Not content to simply progress to the World Cup play-offs, Scotland decided they may as well secure a home semi-final by virtue of seeding. This victory over a previously imperious Denmark team on a special evening on Glasgows south side proved the fitting conclusion to a successful campaign for Steve Clarke and his team. Scotland have won six competitive games in a row for the first time since 1930. Their only frustration is associated with the wait until March for the first of two games Clarke hopes will return this international side to a World Cup after a wait stretching back to 1998. On this evidence, Scotland have nothing to fear. They rattled, harassed and outplayed Denmark. Everything came together, said Clarke. We were always on the front foot. It was a really good night for us. When I came into this job there was a lot of negativity around. Now theres a lot of positivity and the players love it. The players like to be loved and they feel the love of the crowd which is great. Clarkes team closed just four points behind the Danes in Group F. Seeding will render what comes next slightly easier, with Hampden Park in this raucous form quite the backdrop. The switch in public attitudes towards the Scotland team was demonstrated by the scarcity of available tickets for this encounter. Under Clarke, the upwardly mobile Scots have broken the mould of failed campaign after failed campaign. Following this team has become fashionable once more. It was typical of the managers approach that this fixture was deemed significant despite the play-off berth being secured days earlier in Moldova. Understandable Clarke focus also fell on officialdom. Five of the starting XI here  Stephen ODonnell, Billy Gilmour, John McGinn, Che Adams and Andy Robertson  would be suspended for the play-off semi final if collecting a yellow card. No Scotland players were booked as the Danes were swatted aside. Denmarks direct progress to Qatar was sealed long ago. They arrived in Glasgow seeking to complete the perfect 10 out of 10 qualifying wins. In the midst of their run was a comprehensive dismissal of Scotland in Copenhagen. After a bright Scottish start, the visitors served notice of their intentions via Daniel Wass. The Valencia midfielder, arriving late in the penalty area, bundled narrowly wide from Rasmus Kristensens cross. Scotland remained hugely competitive. Midway through the opening half, in concluding a sweeping move kept alive by the tenacity of Ryan Christie, Adams forced Kasper Schmeichel to a terrific save with an outstretched foot. The majority of Hampden was already on its feet to acclaim the opening goal. There began a concerted spell of Scotland pressure. Adams was denied a wonderful goal, following a break as included a spectacular Christie pass, by Simon Kjaers despairing block. Denmark were helpless, though, to prevent John Souttars opener. The Hearts defender, who has endured a horrible time with serious injury, delivered a moment of huge personal significance by nodding home from six yards. Liam Cooper had earlier headed McGinns corner perfectly into Souttars path. The 25-year-olds celebration supplied evidence of his earlier turmoil. Matters simmered down to a dull roar in the opening stages of the second half. Set pieces appeared Scotlands best hope of a crucial second, with Schmeichel looking surprisingly ill at ease under cross balls. Not that open play was completely ineffective; Gilmour tested the Leicester City custodian from long range before Adams cracked a post from a narrow angle. The Southampton forward, who was terrific all evening, was belatedly flagged offside but Tartan Army belief continued to rise. That Robertson, the Scotland captain, limped off with 11 minutes to play placed a minor dampener on the evening for the hosts. Smiles were soon returned to faces. The outstanding Adams stayed onside, ran onto Stuart Armstrongs through pass and slammed beyond Schmeichel. Hampden erupted. The Clarke-led revival of this scene deserves the most fulsome of praise.

Not content to simply progress to the World Cup play-offs, Scotland decided they may as well secure a home semi-final by virtue of seeding. This victory over a previously imperious Denmark team on a special evening on Glasgows south side proved the fitting conclusion to a successful campaign for Steve Clarke and his team. Scotland have won six competitive games in a row for the first time since 1930. Their only frustration is associated with the wait until March for the first of two games Clarke hopes will return this international side to a World Cup after a wait stretching back to 1998. On this evidence, Scotland have nothing to fear. They rattled, harassed and outplayed Denmark. Everything came together, said Clarke. We were always on the front foot. It was a really good night for us. When I came into this job there was a lot of negativity around. Now theres a lot of positivity and the players love it. The players like to be loved and they feel the love of the crowd which is great. Clarkes team closed just four points behind the Danes in Group F. Seeding will render what comes next slightly easier, with Hampden Park in this raucous form quite the backdrop. The switch in public attitudes towards the Scotland team was demonstrated by the scarcity of available tickets for this encounter. Under Clarke, the upwardly mobile Scots have broken the mould of failed campaign after failed campaign. Following this team has become fashionable once more. It was typical of the managers approach that this fixture was deemed significant despite the play-off berth being secured days earlier in Moldova. Understandable Clarke focus also fell on officialdom. Five of the starting XI here  Stephen ODonnell, Billy Gilmour, John McGinn, Che Adams and Andy Robertson  would be suspended for the play-off semi final if collecting a yellow card. No Scotland players were booked as the Danes were swatted aside. Denmarks direct progress to Qatar was sealed long ago. They arrived in Glasgow seeking to complete the perfect 10 out of 10 qualifying wins. In the midst of their run was a comprehensive dismissal of Scotland in Copenhagen. After a bright Scottish start, the visitors served notice of their intentions via Daniel Wass. The Valencia midfielder, arriving late in the penalty area, bundled narrowly wide from Rasmus Kristensens cross. Scotland remained hugely competitive. Midway through the opening half, in concluding a sweeping move kept alive by the tenacity of Ryan Christie, Adams forced Kasper Schmeichel to a terrific save with an outstretched foot. The majority of Hampden was already on its feet to acclaim the opening goal. There began a concerted spell of Scotland pressure. Adams was denied a wonderful goal, following a break as included a spectacular Christie pass, by Simon Kjaers despairing block. Denmark were helpless, though, to prevent John Souttars opener. The Hearts defender, who has endured a horrible time with serious injury, delivered a moment of huge personal significance by nodding home from six yards. Liam Cooper had earlier headed McGinns corner perfectly into Souttars path. The 25-year-olds celebration supplied evidence of his earlier turmoil. Matters simmered down to a dull roar in the opening stages of the second half. Set pieces appeared Scotlands best hope of a crucial second, with Schmeichel looking surprisingly ill at ease under cross balls. Not that open play was completely ineffective; Gilmour tested the Leicester City custodian from long range before Adams cracked a post from a narrow angle. The Southampton forward, who was terrific all evening, was belatedly flagged offside but Tartan Army belief continued to rise.

Not that open play was completely ineffective; Gilmour tested the Leicester City custodian from long range before Adams cracked a post from a narrow angle. The Southampton forward, who was terrific all evening, was belatedly flagged offside but Tartan Army belief continued to rise.

Not content to simply progress to the World Cup play-offs, Scotland decided they may as well secure a home semi-final by virtue of seeding. This victory over a previously imperious Denmark team on a special evening on Glasgows south side proved the fitting conclusion to a successful campaign for Steve Clarke and his team. Scotland have won six competitive games in a row for the first time since 1930. Their only frustration is associated with the wait until March for the first of two games Clarke hopes will return this international side to a World Cup after a wait stretching back to 1998. On this evidence, Scotland have nothing to fear. They rattled, harassed and outplayed Denmark. Everything came together, said Clarke. We were always on the front foot. It was a really good night for us. When I came into this job there was a lot of negativity around. Now theres a lot of positivity and the players love it. The players like to be loved and they feel the love of the crowd which is great. Clarkes team closed just four points behind the Danes in Group F. Seeding will render what comes next slightly easier, with Hampden Park in this raucous form quite the backdrop. The switch in public attitudes towards the Scotland team was demonstrated by the scarcity of available tickets for this encounter. Under Clarke, the upwardly mobile Scots have broken the mould of failed campaign after failed campaign. Following this team has become fashionable once more. It was typical of the managers approach that this fixture was deemed significant despite the play-off berth being secured days earlier in Moldova. Understandable Clarke focus also fell on officialdom. Five of the starting XI here  Stephen ODonnell, Billy Gilmour, John McGinn, Che Adams and Andy Robertson  would be suspended for the play-off semi final if collecting a yellow card. No Scotland players were booked as the Danes were swatted aside. Denmarks direct progress to Qatar was sealed long ago. They arrived in Glasgow seeking to complete the perfect 10 out of 10 qualifying wins. In the midst of their run was a comprehensive dismissal of Scotland in Copenhagen. After a bright Scottish start, the visitors served notice of their intentions via Daniel Wass. The Valencia midfielder, arriving late in the penalty area, bundled narrowly wide from Rasmus Kristensens cross. Scotland remained hugely competitive. Midway through the opening half, in concluding a sweeping move kept alive by the tenacity of Ryan Christie, Adams forced Kasper Schmeichel to a terrific save with an outstretched foot. The majority of Hampden was already on its feet to acclaim the opening goal. There began a concerted spell of Scotland pressure. Adams was denied a wonderful goal, following a break as included a spectacular Christie pass, by Simon Kjaers despairing block. Denmark were helpless, though, to prevent John Souttars opener.

Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatchers government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. Its also about the insularity of the British abroad, said McKeand, blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loachs 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment  set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions. They agreed on Tim Healy and Kevin Whately to play the philosophising Dennis and the ever-homesick Neville, but were stuck on the casting for Oz, the tough character inspired by Connell. Their problem was solved when Jimmy Nail, who had a broken nose and several missing teeth, walked into the auditions. The septet was completed by Timothy Spall as the boring West Midlands electrician Barry, Gary Holton as the womanising cockney carpenter Wayne, Pat Roach as the Bristolian bricklayer and ex-wrestler Bomber, and Christopher Fairbank as the Liverpudlian plasterer Moxey. It was a complicated production. While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Dsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the casts high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities. McKeand then became embroiled in the diplomatic row that followed the screening of Death of a Princess (1980), the drama-documentary he co-produced with the director Antony Thomas, for which he had helped to raise funding from half a dozen countries. After seeing its re-enactment of the public executions of a Saudi royal and her male lover, Saudi Arabia imposed sanctions and ejected Britains ambassador from Riyadh. The programme-makers also had to fight off attacks from Conservative politicians in parliament  and critics who condemned the drama-documentary style. Between making Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, McKeand was Saatchi &amp; Saatchis deputy head of television advertising (1988-89). He returned to TV to produce another comedy-drama by Clement and La Frenais, Full Stretch (1993), starring Kevin McNally as a former footballer running a struggling limousine-hire company, and the first series of Harry (1993), with Michael Elphick as an unscrupulous news agency reporter. McKeands 1965 marriage to Lorna Heaton ended in divorce. He then had a long-term relationship with Jill Forbes, who died in 2001. He is survived by the two children of his marriage, Kate and Richard, his stepson, Alex, and his sister, Janet.  James Martin McKeand, television producer and advertising executive, born 16 August 1935; died 21 January 2022  This article was amended on 3 April 2022. The character Barry from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet has been described as being either from Birmingham or from various towns in the West Midlands. Rather than a Brummie electrician, we have now described him as a West Midlands one.

The septet was completed by Timothy Spall as the boring West Midlands electrician Barry, Gary Holton as the womanising cockney carpenter Wayne, Pat Roach as the Bristolian bricklayer and ex-wrestler Bomber, and Christopher Fairbank as the Liverpudlian plasterer Moxey. It was a complicated production. While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Dsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the casts high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities. McKeand then became embroiled in the diplomatic row that followed the screening of Death of a Princess (1980), the drama-documentary he co-produced with the director Antony Thomas, for which he had helped to raise funding from half a dozen countries. After seeing its re-enactment of the public executions of a Saudi royal and her male lover, Saudi Arabia imposed sanctions and ejected Britains ambassador from Riyadh. The programme-makers also had to fight off attacks from Conservative politicians in parliament  and critics who condemned the drama-documentary style. Between making Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, McKeand was Saatchi &amp; Saatchis deputy head of television advertising (1988-89). He returned to TV to produce another comedy-drama by Clement and La Frenais, Full Stretch (1993), starring Kevin McNally as a former footballer running a struggling limousine-hire company, and the first series of Harry (1993), with Michael Elphick as an unscrupulous news agency reporter. McKeands 1965 marriage to Lorna Heaton ended in divorce. He then had a long-term relationship with Jill Forbes, who died in 2001. He is survived by the two children of his marriage, Kate and Richard, his stepson, Alex, and his sister, Janet.  James Martin McKeand, television producer and advertising executive, born 16 August 1935; died 21 January 2022  This article was amended on 3 April 2022. The character Barry from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet has been described as being either from Birmingham or from various towns in the West Midlands. Rather than a Brummie electrician, we have now described him as a West Midlands one.

Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatchers government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. Its also about the insularity of the British abroad, said McKeand, blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loachs 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment  set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions.

While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Dsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the casts high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities. McKeand then became embroiled in the diplomatic row that followed the screening of Death of a Princess (1980), the drama-documentary he co-produced with the director Antony Thomas, for which he had helped to raise funding from half a dozen countries. After seeing its re-enactment of the public executions of a Saudi royal and her male lover, Saudi Arabia imposed sanctions and ejected Britains ambassador from Riyadh. The programme-makers also had to fight off attacks from Conservative politicians in parliament  and critics who condemned the drama-documentary style. Between making Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, McKeand was Saatchi &amp; Saatchis deputy head of television advertising (1988-89). He returned to TV to produce another comedy-drama by Clement and La Frenais, Full Stretch (1993), starring Kevin McNally as a former footballer running a struggling limousine-hire company, and the first series of Harry (1993), with Michael Elphick as an unscrupulous news agency reporter. McKeands 1965 marriage to Lorna Heaton ended in divorce. He then had a long-term relationship with Jill Forbes, who died in 2001. He is survived by the two children of his marriage, Kate and Richard, his stepson, Alex, and his sister, Janet.  James Martin McKeand, television producer and advertising executive, born 16 August 1935; died 21 January 2022  This article was amended on 3 April 2022. The character Barry from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet has been described as being either from Birmingham or from various towns in the West Midlands.

Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatchers government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. Its also about the insularity of the British abroad, said McKeand, blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loachs 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment  set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions. They agreed on Tim Healy and Kevin Whately to play the philosophising Dennis and the ever-homesick Neville, but were stuck on the casting for Oz, the tough character inspired by Connell. Their problem was solved when Jimmy Nail, who had a broken nose and several missing teeth, walked into the auditions.

Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities. McKeand then became embroiled in the diplomatic row that followed the screening of Death of a Princess (1980), the drama-documentary he co-produced with the director Antony Thomas, for which he had helped to raise funding from half a dozen countries. After seeing its re-enactment of the public executions of a Saudi royal and her male lover, Saudi Arabia imposed sanctions and ejected Britains ambassador from Riyadh. The programme-makers also had to fight off attacks from Conservative politicians in parliament  and critics who condemned the drama-documentary style. Between making Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, McKeand was Saatchi &amp; Saatchis deputy head of television advertising (1988-89). He returned to TV to produce another comedy-drama by Clement and La Frenais, Full Stretch (1993), starring Kevin McNally as a former footballer running a struggling limousine-hire company, and the first series of Harry (1993), with Michael Elphick as an unscrupulous news agency reporter. McKeands 1965 marriage to Lorna Heaton ended in divorce. He then had a long-term relationship with Jill Forbes, who died in 2001. He is survived by the two children of his marriage, Kate and Richard, his stepson, Alex, and his sister, Janet.  James Martin McKeand, television producer and advertising executive, born 16 August 1935; died 21 January 2022  This article was amended on 3 April 2022. The character Barry from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet has been described as being either from Birmingham or from various towns in the West Midlands. Rather than a Brummie electrician, we have now described him as a West Midlands one.

Arsenal were left nursing a sense of injustice after VAR decisions contributed to their dramatic 2-1 defeat against Manchester City, with their assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg, suggesting they had been denied a clear penalty when Martin degaard was challenged by Ederson in the first half. Stuivenberg was overseeing Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, who looked on from home after testing positive for Covid-19. He and his players felt the referee, Stuart Attwell, should have been asked to review Edersons tackle on the monitor, just as he did when awarding City the second-half spot kick from which Riyad Mahrez equalised. I think it is a clear penalty, but at least a moment for the referee to check, like what happened with their penalty, Stuivenberg said. It is inconsistent. Aaron Ramsdale, the Arsenal goalkeeper, was similarly confused after seeing Citys penalty appeal at close quarters. Attwell originally awarded nothing when Bernardo Silva went down under Granit Xhakas challenge but when invited to review the decision by the VAR official, Jarred Gillett, he changed his mind. I dont know why the referee is told to see one and not the other, Ramsdale said. It is there for a reason, go and use it. It is the inconsistency. The whole point is to help the game out. In real time it didnt look like one, [but] slow it down on a screen and it is given. Despite their frustration at not being awarded a penalty, Arsenal surged ahead later in the first half through Bukayo Saka and were by far the better side before Mahrez levelled. The equaliser was followed quickly by a second yellow card for Gabriel Magalhes, whose first was for what Stuivenberg termed a normal comment  no dirty language was used, and Arsenal paid the price through Rodris late winner. Im sad that we dont end up with three points, thats the most frustrating part, Stuivenberg said. Ramsdale agreed: I dont think for large parts of the game teams have done that to Manchester City. An 11th straight win for City gives them an 11-point advantage at the top, although Chelsea and Liverpool have opportunities to reduce it with games in hand. There have been two bigger gaps on New Years Day in the Premier League era. Pep Guardiola accepted City had been fortunate. Arsenal were better, he said, before pointing out that City had two days to recover from their win at Brentford. It was so tough for us to come back. We had no energy. We were incredibly tired and they were better, but football has happened and sometimes it comes in our side.

Arsenal were left nursing a sense of injustice after VAR decisions contributed to their dramatic 2-1 defeat against Manchester City, with their assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg, suggesting they had been denied a clear penalty when Martin degaard was challenged by Ederson in the first half. Stuivenberg was overseeing Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, who looked on from home after testing positive for Covid-19. He and his players felt the referee, Stuart Attwell, should have been asked to review Edersons tackle on the monitor, just as he did when awarding City the second-half spot kick from which Riyad Mahrez equalised. I think it is a clear penalty, but at least a moment for the referee to check, like what happened with their penalty, Stuivenberg said. It is inconsistent. Aaron Ramsdale, the Arsenal goalkeeper, was similarly confused after seeing Citys penalty appeal at close quarters. Attwell originally awarded nothing when Bernardo Silva went down under Granit Xhakas challenge but when invited to review the decision by the VAR official, Jarred Gillett, he changed his mind. I dont know why the referee is told to see one and not the other, Ramsdale said. It is there for a reason, go and use it. It is the inconsistency. The whole point is to help the game out. In real time it didnt look like one, [but] slow it down on a screen and it is given. Despite their frustration at not being awarded a penalty, Arsenal surged ahead later in the first half through Bukayo Saka and were by far the better side before Mahrez levelled. The equaliser was followed quickly by a second yellow card for Gabriel Magalhes, whose first was for what Stuivenberg termed a normal comment  no dirty language was used, and Arsenal paid the price through Rodris late winner. Im sad that we dont end up with three points, thats the most frustrating part, Stuivenberg said. Ramsdale agreed: I dont think for large parts of the game teams have done that to Manchester City. An 11th straight win for City gives them an 11-point advantage at the top, although Chelsea and Liverpool have opportunities to reduce it with games in hand. There have been two bigger gaps on New Years Day in the Premier League era. Pep Guardiola accepted City had been fortunate. Arsenal were better, he said, before pointing out that City had two days to recover from their win at Brentford. It was so tough for us to come back. We had no energy. We were incredibly tired and they were better, but football has happened and sometimes it comes in our side.

Arsenal were left nursing a sense of injustice after VAR decisions contributed to their dramatic 2-1 defeat against Manchester City, with their assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg, suggesting they had been denied a clear penalty when Martin degaard was challenged by Ederson in the first half. Stuivenberg was overseeing Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, who looked on from home after testing positive for Covid-19. He and his players felt the referee, Stuart Attwell, should have been asked to review Edersons tackle on the monitor, just as he did when awarding City the second-half spot kick from which Riyad Mahrez equalised. I think it is a clear penalty, but at least a moment for the referee to check, like what happened with their penalty, Stuivenberg said. It is inconsistent. Aaron Ramsdale, the Arsenal goalkeeper, was similarly confused after seeing Citys penalty appeal at close quarters. Attwell originally awarded nothing when Bernardo Silva went down under Granit Xhakas challenge but when invited to review the decision by the VAR official, Jarred Gillett, he changed his mind. I dont know why the referee is told to see one and not the other, Ramsdale said. It is there for a reason, go and use it. It is the inconsistency. The whole point is to help the game out. In real time it didnt look like one, [but] slow it down on a screen and it is given. Despite their frustration at not being awarded a penalty, Arsenal surged ahead later in the first half through Bukayo Saka and were by far the better side before Mahrez levelled. The equaliser was followed quickly by a second yellow card for Gabriel Magalhes, whose first was for what Stuivenberg termed a normal comment  no dirty language was used, and Arsenal paid the price through Rodris late winner. Im sad that we dont end up with three points, thats the most frustrating part, Stuivenberg said. Ramsdale agreed: I dont think for large parts of the game teams have done that to Manchester City. An 11th straight win for City gives them an 11-point advantage at the top, although Chelsea and Liverpool have opportunities to reduce it with games in hand. There have been two bigger gaps on New Years Day in the Premier League era. Pep Guardiola accepted City had been fortunate. Arsenal were better, he said, before pointing out that City had two days to recover from their win at Brentford. It was so tough for us to come back. We had no energy. We were incredibly tired and they were better, but football has happened and sometimes it comes in our side.

Robert Richards, who has died aged 65 of cancer, was an important figure in the story of the Glastonbury festival. He worked for the festivals founder, Michael Eavis, for more than 30 years, and was producer of the 2006 film Glastonbury, directed by Julien Temple. Robert made the film with backing from Eaviss personal savings, and enlisted Temple to capture every moment of the festival as it happened in 2002  stretching to 2,000 hours of film. At that point Glastonbury was facing something of a crisis, having suffered break-ins and serious overcrowding the year before, and Eavis had been compelled to put up a controversial superfence to keep out intruders. Although it took four years for the film to be released, it remains the defining record of the festivals first half-century. Born in Finsbury Park, north London, Robert was the son of Ann (nee Platt) and Robert, a design engineer. While at Woodberry Down comprehensive he played rugby for school, county and country. Eventually he decided not to pursue the sport, growing his hair long and hanging around at Finsbury Parks Rainbow theatre to chat backstage to musicians, among them Eric Clapton and David Bowie. He spent a year at the University of Bristol (1974-75) studying politics, philosophy and economics, but then gave up, switching to do the same subject at City, University of London  and calling it a day after a year there, too. By then Robert had began to make a string of underground films, all of which have since been lost, except one  Krasny: An Introduction to Philosophical Thinking  registered at the BFI in 1999. He also sold candles, and, for a while, tea in Covent Garden. It was a vanload of candles that took him to Glastonbury festival in the early 1990s  he went there to sell them to punters but came back in following years to work for the festival in its information area, initially in the Green Fields section with CND. Later he helped Melvin Benn secure the festival licence and began to work more closely with Eavis as Glastonbury grew to become one of the biggest outdoor events in the world. By then settled in Somerset, he also became involved in the growth of Somerset Film, a charity dedicated to nurturing new film making talent; he was one of the founding trustees in 1999. Aside from his work with the festival he kept goats on a smallholding in Withypool on Exmoor, became a trustee of Glastonbury Abbey and, more recently, chair of the Glastonbury Town Fund Board, which raised 24m for the town in 2021. An astute negotiator, Robert worked closely with the Eavis family and the core festival team on forging new partnerships and opportunities, including a longstanding media partnership with the Guardian that began in 1998 and continues to this day. Roberts first marriage, to Victoria (nee Thomas), ended in divorce in 2010. He is survived by his second wife, Ann-Marie (nee Buckley), whom he married in 2011, his mother and his sister, Elizabeth.

Born in Finsbury Park, north London, Robert was the son of Ann (nee Platt) and Robert, a design engineer. While at Woodberry Down comprehensive he played rugby for school, county and country. Eventually he decided not to pursue the sport, growing his hair long and hanging around at Finsbury Parks Rainbow theatre to chat backstage to musicians, among them Eric Clapton and David Bowie. He spent a year at the University of Bristol (1974-75) studying politics, philosophy and economics, but then gave up, switching to do the same subject at City, University of London  and calling it a day after a year there, too. By then Robert had began to make a string of underground films, all of which have since been lost, except one  Krasny: An Introduction to Philosophical Thinking  registered at the BFI in 1999. He also sold candles, and, for a while, tea in Covent Garden. It was a vanload of candles that took him to Glastonbury festival in the early 1990s  he went there to sell them to punters but came back in following years to work for the festival in its information area, initially in the Green Fields section with CND. Later he helped Melvin Benn secure the festival licence and began to work more closely with Eavis as Glastonbury grew to become one of the biggest outdoor events in the world. By then settled in Somerset, he also became involved in the growth of Somerset Film, a charity dedicated to nurturing new film making talent; he was one of the founding trustees in 1999. Aside from his work with the festival he kept goats on a smallholding in Withypool on Exmoor, became a trustee of Glastonbury Abbey and, more recently, chair of the Glastonbury Town Fund Board, which raised 24m for the town in 2021. An astute negotiator, Robert worked closely with the Eavis family and the core festival team on forging new partnerships and opportunities, including a longstanding media partnership with the Guardian that began in 1998 and continues to this day. Roberts first marriage, to Victoria (nee Thomas), ended in divorce in 2010. He is survived by his second wife, Ann-Marie (nee Buckley), whom he married in 2011, his mother and his sister, Elizabeth.

End-of-season games often have a slightly curious dynamic, a sense of being played at cross-purposes. On the one hand, there was Manchester City battling for the win as they pursue a fourth league title in five years. On the other, West Ham basking in the knockings of a season well done and determined to celebrate the final home game of one of their greatest recent players, Mark Noble. When Noble came on with quarter of an hour remaining, what did that mean? He had played just 308 league minutes previously this season. Would he have come on had this not been his grand farewell? Does it matter? Would Liverpool fans who, if social media was anything to go by, were bizarrely aggrieved by the VAR award of an obvious penalty, have been aggrieved that West Ham in effect turned the final quarter of an hour into a testimonial? As it was, with Lukasz Fabianski saving that Riyad Mahrez penalty, the score remained 2-2, meaning that there is still life in the Premier League title race, that there remains the possibility that Steven Gerrard could at last win Liverpool a league title by leading his Aston Villa side to a point or better at the Etihad next weekend. But the Noble factor shaped the game. This was, after all, as the pitchside announcer insisted, Mark Noble Day: the post-match obsequies were so maudlin they might have been a funeral on EastEnders. There were montages  one of our own, Canning Town-born, claret-and-blue-raised, that Custom House grit; a voiceover from Danny Dyer; Ben Shephard on the pitch; testimony from fans, at least one of whom had named their dog after him; clips of him in various scenarios in various seasons, hair magnificently consistent (his son, happily, seems to have inherited the family parting); and a minutes applause in the 17th minute in celebration of his No 16 shirt. Pep Guardiola gave him a hug and a lengthy lecture at the final whistle. Even Prince Albert II of Monaco came to pay his respects. This has been another good year for West Ham. There have been memorable wins over Liverpool and Chelsea, a Europa League run that will be talked about for years and a sense that the London Stadium has at last come to feel like home. Maybe theyll qualify for the Europa League again, may have to be content with the Europa Conference League, but the distinction is never going to generate the sort of tension that might have impinged on the general good humour. One team was relaxed, one was not and, for a time, that threatened a serious upset. It wouldnt quite be true to say West Ham were 2-0 up at halftime by mistake, but there was an odd sense that the pressure that is usually induced by Citys domination of the ball simply wasnt there. And when the ball was belted forward, when the space behind Citys characteristically high line was tested, Michail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen went galloping gleefully after it. It all seemed tremendous fun. Citys press was shaky, their willingness to compete for second balls limited. Were they really going to blow it in such a characteristic way? They did not, and a draw should still be enough. But this at least was a proper examination, they had to pass a test of their character and will have another one next Sunday. If they do hold on to defend the title, this will have been far harder won than the title of 2018-19, when City and Liverpool each cantered to win after win over the final two months of the season. This has been a run-in with at least a few twists and turns, with the possibility of one more to come. The pivotal moment, in the end, came after 65 minutes with the score at 2-1 as Antonio, inadvertently sent clean through by Fernandinho, pulled his chip over Ederson just wide. Had that gone in  or had Bowen not slightly selfishly dragged an effort into the side-netting when he might have squared it a minute earlier  this might still have been a costly afternoon for City. As it was, West Ham followed the path of so many David Moyes sides before them by dropping deeper and deeper, inviting pressure and, inevitably, conceding. With the scores level, West Ham immediately stepped out and City began to look threatened again. City had chances to win it and they were, of course, the better side, as xG has had them in every single game this season, but in the minutes after the penalty, as they chased a winner that would in effect have secured the league title, they were oddly lacking in imagination. Rodri was thrown up front, a glimpse of what a big No 9 might look like in a City side next season, an uncomfortable temporary addition to the lineage that runs from Niall Quinn to Erling Haaland, and crosses slung into the box  although the only player who actually got on the end of one of them was Vladimir Coufal, who scored the equaliser with a diving header into his own net. After two facile wins, this was all a little unconvincing from City. But thats how it should be. Thats what title races are supposed to be about, the contenders choking on their anxieties as laid-back opponents with little to play for operate, for worse and sometimes for better, to a different set of priorities.

End-of-season games often have a slightly curious dynamic, a sense of being played at cross-purposes. On the one hand, there was Manchester City battling for the win as they pursue a fourth league title in five years. On the other, West Ham basking in the knockings of a season well done and determined to celebrate the final home game of one of their greatest recent players, Mark Noble. When Noble came on with quarter of an hour remaining, what did that mean? He had played just 308 league minutes previously this season. Would he have come on had this not been his grand farewell? Does it matter? Would Liverpool fans who, if social media was anything to go by, were bizarrely aggrieved by the VAR award of an obvious penalty, have been aggrieved that West Ham in effect turned the final quarter of an hour into a testimonial? As it was, with Lukasz Fabianski saving that Riyad Mahrez penalty, the score remained 2-2, meaning that there is still life in the Premier League title race, that there remains the possibility that Steven Gerrard could at last win Liverpool a league title by leading his Aston Villa side to a point or better at the Etihad next weekend.

As the evening wore on Antonio Conte resembled an increasingly disappointed teacher, apparently saddened by his classs failure to absorb the basic lessons he had devoted hours to imparting. Tottenhams manager did not looked entirely surprised when his worst fears were realised and, deep in extra time, the 19yearold Josh Coburn, after only 11 minutes on the pitch, scored a fine, richly deserved winner, propelling Chris Wilders impressive side into the sixth round. Although Contes Tottenham  and Harry Kane in particular  were far from their best, considerable credit must go to their meticulously organised opponents from the Championship and, in particular, Jonny Howson, who shone in a defensive midfield role. Although Kane had a secondhalf goal disallowed for offside Boro, who won on penalties at Manchester United in the last round, finished the stronger side  suggesting they would not be out of their depth in the Premier League. It was amazing, a great result for our football club, said Wilder, who was delighted to play in front of the Riversides first capacity, near-35,000 crowd for five years. Its brilliant to have beaten a top side with an outstanding manager  and a great moment for Josh. Conte said: We lost a good chance to go to the quarter-final. Theres disappointment. We didnt take our chances. Middlesbrough deserved to go to the next round. We compliment them. But we should have killed the game. We have too many up and downs. I have to be patient and work very hard to make this team more stable. We have to improve. I have to find the best solution; sometimes the coach has to use the stick. Wilder jokes that Conte likes to copy his tactical three-at-the-back blueprint and, sure enough, both managers fielded wing-back-propelled sides. Howsons deployment in a deep-lying midfield role proved pivotal though and he played a key role in ensuring Conte, who fielded the side which started the 4-0 win at Leeds last Saturday, would not be lifting the FA Cup this season after all. Except for Dael Fry making a vital interception to deny Kane after Ryan Sessegnon advanced with menace from left wing-back, the first half was not exactly replete with chances. Generally a disciplined Boro side featuring some decent midfield cameos, including Matt Crooks, hogged plenty of possession but kept things fairly tight. Retaining their composure, Wilders players took no unnecessary attacking risks as Spurs seemed content to play very much on the counterattack. In the absence of much goalmouth action  even though Matt Doherty rounded the Boro goalkeeper Joe Lumley only to shoot wide  Isaiah Jones consistently looked the home player most capable of getting behind Contes backline as he ultimately dominated his intriguing subplot with Sessegnon. When Duncan Watmore accelerated beyond three visiting defenders Jones promptly collapsed in close proximity to Sessegnon. The Riverside demanded a penalty but Darren England, the referee, was not fooled, swiftly dismissing Boros forlorn appeals but, perhaps leniently, allowing Jones to escape a yellow card. That incident seemed to, briefly, bring out a certain indignation in Spurs and, shortly afterwards, Lumley did well to divert Eric Diers subtly curving free-kick for a corner. Significantly Dier and his fellow defender Ben Davies proved rare strong performers for Conte. Kane thought he had volleyed his side ahead after connecting with a flick-on from the ensuing corner but was denied by an offside flag. Overall the unusually irritable looking England centre-forward struggled to hit the imperious heights he reached at Leeds and it seemed thoroughly emblematic of his rather indifferent evening when he slipped while taking a dangerously placed freekick. Howson very nearly showed him how to do it, curling a dead ball of his own fractionally wide. It left Conte running through his full repertoire of sorrowful technical area expressions and, immediately after the unmarked Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun lent back and shot off target when well placed, Tottenhams manager switched to a back four. With Wilder having done likewise Boro finished the opening 90 minutes very much in the ascendant with Hugo Lloris saving from Jones, twice, Crooks and Marcus Tavernier , while Howson missed a sitter in extra time. Eventually Coburn deservedly broke the impasse. The teenager, from just down the road in Bedale, and who joined Boro after being discarded by Sunderland , was not long off the bench when he met Crookss clever pass and, holding off Cristian Romero, lashed a rising, angled shot unerringly past Lloris and on into the top corner.

Its brilliant to have beaten a top side with an outstanding manager  and a great moment for Josh. Conte said: We lost a good chance to go to the quarter-final. Theres disappointment. We didnt take our chances. Middlesbrough deserved to go to the next round. We compliment them. But we should have killed the game. We have too many up and downs. I have to be patient and work very hard to make this team more stable. We have to improve. I have to find the best solution; sometimes the coach has to use the stick. Wilder jokes that Conte likes to copy his tactical three-at-the-back blueprint and, sure enough, both managers fielded wing-back-propelled sides. Howsons deployment in a deep-lying midfield role proved pivotal though and he played a key role in ensuring Conte, who fielded the side which started the 4-0 win at Leeds last Saturday, would not be lifting the FA Cup this season after all. Except for Dael Fry making a vital interception to deny Kane after Ryan Sessegnon advanced with menace from left wing-back, the first half was not exactly replete with chances. Generally a disciplined Boro side featuring some decent midfield cameos, including Matt Crooks, hogged plenty of possession but kept things fairly tight. Retaining their composure, Wilders players took no unnecessary attacking risks as Spurs seemed content to play very much on the counterattack. In the absence of much goalmouth action  even though Matt Doherty rounded the Boro goalkeeper Joe Lumley only to shoot wide  Isaiah Jones consistently looked the home player most capable of getting behind Contes backline as he ultimately dominated his intriguing subplot with Sessegnon. When Duncan Watmore accelerated beyond three visiting defenders Jones promptly collapsed in close proximity to Sessegnon. The Riverside demanded a penalty but Darren England, the referee, was not fooled, swiftly dismissing Boros forlorn appeals but, perhaps leniently, allowing Jones to escape a yellow card. That incident seemed to, briefly, bring out a certain indignation in Spurs and, shortly afterwards, Lumley did well to divert Eric Diers subtly curving free-kick for a corner. Significantly Dier and his fellow defender Ben Davies proved rare strong performers for Conte. Kane thought he had volleyed his side ahead after connecting with a flick-on from the ensuing corner but was denied by an offside flag. Overall the unusually irritable looking England centre-forward struggled to hit the imperious heights he reached at Leeds and it seemed thoroughly emblematic of his rather indifferent evening when he slipped while taking a dangerously placed freekick. Howson very nearly showed him how to do it, curling a dead ball of his own fractionally wide. It left Conte running through his full repertoire of sorrowful technical area expressions and, immediately after the unmarked Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun lent back and shot off target when well placed, Tottenhams manager switched to a back four. With Wilder having done likewise Boro finished the opening 90 minutes very much in the ascendant with Hugo Lloris saving from Jones, twice, Crooks and Marcus Tavernier , while Howson missed a sitter in extra time. Eventually Coburn deservedly broke the impasse. The teenager, from just down the road in Bedale, and who joined Boro after being discarded by Sunderland , was not long off the bench when he met Crookss clever pass and, holding off Cristian Romero, lashed a rising, angled shot unerringly past Lloris and on into the top corner.

Its brilliant to have beaten a top side with an outstanding manager  and a great moment for Josh. Conte said: We lost a good chance to go to the quarter-final. Theres disappointment. We didnt take our chances. Middlesbrough deserved to go to the next round. We compliment them. But we should have killed the game. We have too many up and downs. I have to be patient and work very hard to make this team more stable. We have to improve. I have to find the best solution; sometimes the coach has to use the stick. Wilder jokes that Conte likes to copy his tactical three-at-the-back blueprint and, sure enough, both managers fielded wing-back-propelled sides. Howsons deployment in a deep-lying midfield role proved pivotal though and he played a key role in ensuring Conte, who fielded the side which started the 4-0 win at Leeds last Saturday, would not be lifting the FA Cup this season after all. Except for Dael Fry making a vital interception to deny Kane after Ryan Sessegnon advanced with menace from left wing-back, the first half was not exactly replete with chances. Generally a disciplined Boro side featuring some decent midfield cameos, including Matt Crooks, hogged plenty of possession but kept things fairly tight. Retaining their composure, Wilders players took no unnecessary attacking risks as Spurs seemed content to play very much on the counterattack. In the absence of much goalmouth action  even though Matt Doherty rounded the Boro goalkeeper Joe Lumley only to shoot wide  Isaiah Jones consistently looked the home player most capable of getting behind Contes backline as he ultimately dominated his intriguing subplot with Sessegnon. When Duncan Watmore accelerated beyond three visiting defenders Jones promptly collapsed in close proximity to Sessegnon. The Riverside demanded a penalty but Darren England, the referee, was not fooled, swiftly dismissing Boros forlorn appeals but, perhaps leniently, allowing Jones to escape a yellow card. That incident seemed to, briefly, bring out a certain indignation in Spurs and, shortly afterwards, Lumley did well to divert Eric Diers subtly curving free-kick for a corner. Significantly Dier and his fellow defender Ben Davies proved rare strong performers for Conte. Kane thought he had volleyed his side ahead after connecting with a flick-on from the ensuing corner but was denied by an offside flag. Overall the unusually irritable looking England centre-forward struggled to hit the imperious heights he reached at Leeds and it seemed thoroughly emblematic of his rather indifferent evening when he slipped while taking a dangerously placed freekick. Howson very nearly showed him how to do it, curling a dead ball of his own fractionally wide. It left Conte running through his full repertoire of sorrowful technical area expressions and, immediately after the unmarked Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun lent back and shot off target when well placed, Tottenhams manager switched to a back four. With Wilder having done likewise Boro finished the opening 90 minutes very much in the ascendant with Hugo Lloris saving from Jones, twice, Crooks and Marcus Tavernier , while Howson missed a sitter in extra time. Eventually Coburn deservedly broke the impasse. The teenager, from just down the road in Bedale, and who joined Boro after being discarded by Sunderland , was not long off the bench when he met Crookss clever pass and, holding off Cristian Romero, lashed a rising, angled shot unerringly past Lloris and on into the top corner.

As the evening wore on Antonio Conte resembled an increasingly disappointed teacher, apparently saddened by his classs failure to absorb the basic lessons he had devoted hours to imparting. Tottenhams manager did not looked entirely surprised when his worst fears were realised and, deep in extra time, the 19yearold Josh Coburn, after only 11 minutes on the pitch, scored a fine, richly deserved winner, propelling Chris Wilders impressive side into the sixth round. Although Contes Tottenham  and Harry Kane in particular  were far from their best, considerable credit must go to their meticulously organised opponents from the Championship and, in particular, Jonny Howson, who shone in a defensive midfield role.

Jordan Pickford says that he prefers to face a penalty taker who just puts his foot through it, but, with the Euro 2020 final on the line in July, it was all about who would blink first: him or the Italy midfielder Jorginho. Pickford had already saved one from Andrea Belotti in the shootout. Now he had to keep out a second, because, if Jorginho scored, it would be over. When Jorginho performed his trademark skip before the contact, Pickford did not move. When he opened up his body slightly on the way down, to hint at a side-foot for the bottom right-hand corner, the goalkeeper did not move. Now Jorginho went the other way and now Pickford moved. Now he made the save. As an advertisement for Pickfords composure and maturity, not to mention his preparation work, it took some beating. But this was the culmination of a personal journey for the 27-year-old, the reason why he says that he is in the form of his career, the low points and questioning of him in the first part of last season having given way to calm and assurance, to sounder game management. The final would end in pain when Bukayo Saka missed the next kick but Pickfords determination to learn from experiences, both good and bad, will feed into the mission to go one step further at next years World Cup in Qatar. The qualification campaign continues against Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday; win and England would be virtually there. We came up short against Italy but as players, as a squad and as a nation it just drives us on to do better and go to that World Cup and try to win it, Pickford says. A perfect example is France. They came runners-up in the 2016 Euros and then went and won the World Cup. So those painful defeats, youve got to take as a learning curve. Pickford suffered at the start of last season and not only because of the backlash to his red-mist challenge on Liverpools Virgil van Dijk in October. His form for Everton was up and down. Carlo Ancelotti, the clubs manager at the time, had warned him in July that his performances had to improve and, in November, he dropped him for the game against Newcastle. I would say it was something new for me, Pickford says. It was the first game that I missed in the Premier League since I got to Everton [in 2017] but I took it that he was doing it for the right reasons. I have spoken previously about using a psychologist and getting better with different aspects of being the best I can be. It was all from last season, it was a new process for myself to be the best Jordan Pickford I can be and that is all I want to be in different aspects. I had a couple of injuries last year which wasnt ideal but it gave me that opportunity to work hard with the staff and come back [in April] and I think I have been doing well since then. Pickfords status as the England No 1 was a subject for debate in the early months of last season but not for Gareth Southgate. Its been questioned externally but never internally, the manager says. And his performances have always warranted that faith. It is sometimes easy for supporters to judge England players on their displays at club level but Southgate prioritises what he sees during international training and matches. Pickford was injured for the first batch of World Cup qualifiers in March but, since his return, he has conceded only two goals in nine England starts. He was excellent at the Euros. Jordans calmness in the matches  in the last six months especially  has been a real standout and a progression, Southgate says. Its never been an issue in our games but generally, across the board, its an area hes paid attention to. Hes certainly seen the rewards of that. Pickfords shot-stopping and distribution have long marked him out but he has finessed the latter to appear more complete. The biggest thing is decision making  making the right pass at the right time  if its a counterattack or whether I need to take the sting out of the game and give the lads a breather, he says. If Im in charge of the ball, I need to manage the game. Thats what Ive improved on most. England are in what must be called a good moment and Southgate smiled when it was put to him that things might even be going a little too well. Where previously there has been hope, there is now the expectation of success and nobody in the setup seems fearful of saying they are in the World Cup to win it. Consider how the team has defended in the last 25 games  going back to October 2019. It is only seven goals conceded and here is the platform, the basis for the optimism. Pickford will keep on pushing.

England are in what must be called a good moment and Southgate smiled when it was put to him that things might even be going a little too well.

Jordan Pickford says that he prefers to face a penalty taker who just puts his foot through it, but, with the Euro 2020 final on the line in July, it was all about who would blink first: him or the Italy midfielder Jorginho. Pickford had already saved one from Andrea Belotti in the shootout. Now he had to keep out a second, because, if Jorginho scored, it would be over. When Jorginho performed his trademark skip before the contact, Pickford did not move. When he opened up his body slightly on the way down, to hint at a side-foot for the bottom right-hand corner, the goalkeeper did not move. Now Jorginho went the other way and now Pickford moved. Now he made the save. As an advertisement for Pickfords composure and maturity, not to mention his preparation work, it took some beating. But this was the culmination of a personal journey for the 27-year-old, the reason why he says that he is in the form of his career, the low points and questioning of him in the first part of last season having given way to calm and assurance, to sounder game management. The final would end in pain when Bukayo Saka missed the next kick but Pickfords determination to learn from experiences, both good and bad, will feed into the mission to go one step further at next years World Cup in Qatar. The qualification campaign continues against Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday; win and England would be virtually there. We came up short against Italy but as players, as a squad and as a nation it just drives us on to do better and go to that World Cup and try to win it, Pickford says. A perfect example is France. They came runners-up in the 2016 Euros and then went and won the World Cup. So those painful defeats, youve got to take as a learning curve. Pickford suffered at the start of last season and not only because of the backlash to his red-mist challenge on Liverpools Virgil van Dijk in October. His form for Everton was up and down. Carlo Ancelotti, the clubs manager at the time, had warned him in July that his performances had to improve and, in November, he dropped him for the game against Newcastle. I would say it was something new for me, Pickford says. It was the first game that I missed in the Premier League since I got to Everton [in 2017] but I took it that he was doing it for the right reasons. I have spoken previously about using a psychologist and getting better with different aspects of being the best I can be. It was all from last season, it was a new process for myself to be the best Jordan Pickford I can be and that is all I want to be in different aspects. I had a couple of injuries last year which wasnt ideal but it gave me that opportunity to work hard with the staff and come back [in April] and I think I have been doing well since then. Pickfords status as the England No 1 was a subject for debate in the early months of last season but not for Gareth Southgate. Its been questioned externally but never internally, the manager says. And his performances have always warranted that faith. It is sometimes easy for supporters to judge England players on their displays at club level but Southgate prioritises what he sees during international training and matches. Pickford was injured for the first batch of World Cup qualifiers in March but, since his return, he has conceded only two goals in nine England starts. He was excellent at the Euros. Jordans calmness in the matches  in the last six months especially  has been a real standout and a progression, Southgate says. Its never been an issue in our games but generally, across the board, its an area hes paid attention to. Hes certainly seen the rewards of that. Pickfords shot-stopping and distribution have long marked him out but he has finessed the latter to appear more complete.

Pickford suffered at the start of last season and not only because of the backlash to his red-mist challenge on Liverpools Virgil van Dijk in October. His form for Everton was up and down. Carlo Ancelotti, the clubs manager at the time, had warned him in July that his performances had to improve and, in November, he dropped him for the game against Newcastle. I would say it was something new for me, Pickford says. It was the first game that I missed in the Premier League since I got to Everton [in 2017] but I took it that he was doing it for the right reasons. I have spoken previously about using a psychologist and getting better with different aspects of being the best I can be. It was all from last season, it was a new process for myself to be the best Jordan Pickford I can be and that is all I want to be in different aspects. I had a couple of injuries last year which wasnt ideal but it gave me that opportunity to work hard with the staff and come back [in April] and I think I have been doing well since then. Pickfords status as the England No 1 was a subject for debate in the early months of last season but not for Gareth Southgate. Its been questioned externally but never internally, the manager says. And his performances have always warranted that faith. It is sometimes easy for supporters to judge England players on their displays at club level but Southgate prioritises what he sees during international training and matches. Pickford was injured for the first batch of World Cup qualifiers in March but, since his return, he has conceded only two goals in nine England starts. He was excellent at the Euros. Jordans calmness in the matches  in the last six months especially  has been a real standout and a progression, Southgate says. Its never been an issue in our games but generally, across the board, its an area hes paid attention to. Hes certainly seen the rewards of that. Pickfords shot-stopping and distribution have long marked him out but he has finessed the latter to appear more complete. The biggest thing is decision making  making the right pass at the right time  if its a counterattack or whether I need to take the sting out of the game and give the lads a breather, he says. If Im in charge of the ball, I need to manage the game. Thats what Ive improved on most. England are in what must be called a good moment and Southgate smiled when it was put to him that things might even be going a little too well. Where previously there has been hope, there is now the expectation of success and nobody in the setup seems fearful of saying they are in the World Cup to win it. Consider how the team has defended in the last 25 games  going back to October 2019. It is only seven goals conceded and here is the platform, the basis for the optimism. Pickford will keep on pushing.

Jordan Pickford says that he prefers to face a penalty taker who just puts his foot through it, but, with the Euro 2020 final on the line in July, it was all about who would blink first: him or the Italy midfielder Jorginho. Pickford had already saved one from Andrea Belotti in the shootout. Now he had to keep out a second, because, if Jorginho scored, it would be over. When Jorginho performed his trademark skip before the contact, Pickford did not move. When he opened up his body slightly on the way down, to hint at a side-foot for the bottom right-hand corner, the goalkeeper did not move. Now Jorginho went the other way and now Pickford moved. Now he made the save. As an advertisement for Pickfords composure and maturity, not to mention his preparation work, it took some beating. But this was the culmination of a personal journey for the 27-year-old, the reason why he says that he is in the form of his career, the low points and questioning of him in the first part of last season having given way to calm and assurance, to sounder game management. The final would end in pain when Bukayo Saka missed the next kick but Pickfords determination to learn from experiences, both good and bad, will feed into the mission to go one step further at next years World Cup in Qatar. The qualification campaign continues against Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday; win and England would be virtually there.

Jordan Pickford says that he prefers to face a penalty taker who just puts his foot through it, but, with the Euro 2020 final on the line in July, it was all about who would blink first: him or the Italy midfielder Jorginho. Pickford had already saved one from Andrea Belotti in the shootout. Now he had to keep out a second, because, if Jorginho scored, it would be over. When Jorginho performed his trademark skip before the contact, Pickford did not move. When he opened up his body slightly on the way down, to hint at a side-foot for the bottom right-hand corner, the goalkeeper did not move. Now Jorginho went the other way and now Pickford moved. Now he made the save. As an advertisement for Pickfords composure and maturity, not to mention his preparation work, it took some beating. But this was the culmination of a personal journey for the 27-year-old, the reason why he says that he is in the form of his career, the low points and questioning of him in the first part of last season having given way to calm and assurance, to sounder game management. The final would end in pain when Bukayo Saka missed the next kick but Pickfords determination to learn from experiences, both good and bad, will feed into the mission to go one step further at next years World Cup in Qatar. The qualification campaign continues against Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday; win and England would be virtually there. We came up short against Italy but as players, as a squad and as a nation it just drives us on to do better and go to that World Cup and try to win it, Pickford says. A perfect example is France. They came runners-up in the 2016 Euros and then went and won the World Cup. So those painful defeats, youve got to take as a learning curve. Pickford suffered at the start of last season and not only because of the backlash to his red-mist challenge on Liverpools Virgil van Dijk in October. His form for Everton was up and down. Carlo Ancelotti, the clubs manager at the time, had warned him in July that his performances had to improve and, in November, he dropped him for the game against Newcastle. I would say it was something new for me, Pickford says. It was the first game that I missed in the Premier League since I got to Everton [in 2017] but I took it that he was doing it for the right reasons. I have spoken previously about using a psychologist and getting better with different aspects of being the best I can be. It was all from last season, it was a new process for myself to be the best Jordan Pickford I can be and that is all I want to be in different aspects. I had a couple of injuries last year which wasnt ideal but it gave me that opportunity to work hard with the staff and come back [in April] and I think I have been doing well since then. Pickfords status as the England No 1 was a subject for debate in the early months of last season but not for Gareth Southgate. Its been questioned externally but never internally, the manager says. And his performances have always warranted that faith. It is sometimes easy for supporters to judge England players on their displays at club level but Southgate prioritises what he sees during international training and matches. Pickford was injured for the first batch of World Cup qualifiers in March but, since his return, he has conceded only two goals in nine England starts. He was excellent at the Euros. Jordans calmness in the matches  in the last six months especially  has been a real standout and a progression, Southgate says. Its never been an issue in our games but generally, across the board, its an area hes paid attention to. Hes certainly seen the rewards of that. Pickfords shot-stopping and distribution have long marked him out but he has finessed the latter to appear more complete. The biggest thing is decision making  making the right pass at the right time  if its a counterattack or whether I need to take the sting out of the game and give the lads a breather, he says. If Im in charge of the ball, I need to manage the game. Thats what Ive improved on most. England are in what must be called a good moment and Southgate smiled when it was put to him that things might even be going a little too well. Where previously there has been hope, there is now the expectation of success and nobody in the setup seems fearful of saying they are in the World Cup to win it. Consider how the team has defended in the last 25 games  going back to October 2019. It is only seven goals conceded and here is the platform, the basis for the optimism. Pickford will keep on pushing.

I had a couple of injuries last year which wasnt ideal but it gave me that opportunity to work hard with the staff and come back [in April] and I think I have been doing well since then. Pickfords status as the England No 1 was a subject for debate in the early months of last season but not for Gareth Southgate. Its been questioned externally but never internally, the manager says. And his performances have always warranted that faith. It is sometimes easy for supporters to judge England players on their displays at club level but Southgate prioritises what he sees during international training and matches. Pickford was injured for the first batch of World Cup qualifiers in March but, since his return, he has conceded only two goals in nine England starts. He was excellent at the Euros. Jordans calmness in the matches  in the last six months especially  has been a real standout and a progression, Southgate says. Its never been an issue in our games but generally, across the board, its an area hes paid attention to. Hes certainly seen the rewards of that. Pickfords shot-stopping and distribution have long marked him out but he has finessed the latter to appear more complete. The biggest thing is decision making  making the right pass at the right time  if its a counterattack or whether I need to take the sting out of the game and give the lads a breather, he says. If Im in charge of the ball, I need to manage the game. Thats what Ive improved on most. England are in what must be called a good moment and Southgate smiled when it was put to him that things might even be going a little too well. Where previously there has been hope, there is now the expectation of success and nobody in the setup seems fearful of saying they are in the World Cup to win it. Consider how the team has defended in the last 25 games  going back to October 2019. It is only seven goals conceded and here is the platform, the basis for the optimism. Pickford will keep on pushing.

Jordan Pickford says that he prefers to face a penalty taker who just puts his foot through it, but, with the Euro 2020 final on the line in July, it was all about who would blink first: him or the Italy midfielder Jorginho. Pickford had already saved one from Andrea Belotti in the shootout. Now he had to keep out a second, because, if Jorginho scored, it would be over. When Jorginho performed his trademark skip before the contact, Pickford did not move. When he opened up his body slightly on the way down, to hint at a side-foot for the bottom right-hand corner, the goalkeeper did not move. Now Jorginho went the other way and now Pickford moved. Now he made the save. As an advertisement for Pickfords composure and maturity, not to mention his preparation work, it took some beating. But this was the culmination of a personal journey for the 27-year-old, the reason why he says that he is in the form of his career, the low points and questioning of him in the first part of last season having given way to calm and assurance, to sounder game management. The final would end in pain when Bukayo Saka missed the next kick but Pickfords determination to learn from experiences, both good and bad, will feed into the mission to go one step further at next years World Cup in Qatar. The qualification campaign continues against Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday; win and England would be virtually there. We came up short against Italy but as players, as a squad and as a nation it just drives us on to do better and go to that World Cup and try to win it, Pickford says. A perfect example is France. They came runners-up in the 2016 Euros and then went and won the World Cup. So those painful defeats, youve got to take as a learning curve. Pickford suffered at the start of last season and not only because of the backlash to his red-mist challenge on Liverpools Virgil van Dijk in October. His form for Everton was up and down. Carlo Ancelotti, the clubs manager at the time, had warned him in July that his performances had to improve and, in November, he dropped him for the game against Newcastle. I would say it was something new for me, Pickford says. It was the first game that I missed in the Premier League since I got to Everton [in 2017] but I took it that he was doing it for the right reasons.

When Jorginho performed his trademark skip before the contact, Pickford did not move. When he opened up his body slightly on the way down, to hint at a side-foot for the bottom right-hand corner, the goalkeeper did not move. Now Jorginho went the other way and now Pickford moved. Now he made the save. As an advertisement for Pickfords composure and maturity, not to mention his preparation work, it took some beating. But this was the culmination of a personal journey for the 27-year-old, the reason why he says that he is in the form of his career, the low points and questioning of him in the first part of last season having given way to calm and assurance, to sounder game management. The final would end in pain when Bukayo Saka missed the next kick but Pickfords determination to learn from experiences, both good and bad, will feed into the mission to go one step further at next years World Cup in Qatar. The qualification campaign continues against Poland in Warsaw on Wednesday; win and England would be virtually there. We came up short against Italy but as players, as a squad and as a nation it just drives us on to do better and go to that World Cup and try to win it, Pickford says. A perfect example is France. They came runners-up in the 2016 Euros and then went and won the World Cup. So those painful defeats, youve got to take as a learning curve. Pickford suffered at the start of last season and not only because of the backlash to his red-mist challenge on Liverpools Virgil van Dijk in October. His form for Everton was up and down. Carlo Ancelotti, the clubs manager at the time, had warned him in July that his performances had to improve and, in November, he dropped him for the game against Newcastle. I would say it was something new for me, Pickford says. It was the first game that I missed in the Premier League since I got to Everton [in 2017] but I took it that he was doing it for the right reasons. I have spoken previously about using a psychologist and getting better with different aspects of being the best I can be. It was all from last season, it was a new process for myself to be the best Jordan Pickford I can be and that is all I want to be in different aspects. I had a couple of injuries last year which wasnt ideal but it gave me that opportunity to work hard with the staff and come back [in April] and I think I have been doing well since then. Pickfords status as the England No 1 was a subject for debate in the early months of last season but not for Gareth Southgate. Its been questioned externally but never internally, the manager says. And his performances have always warranted that faith. It is sometimes easy for supporters to judge England players on their displays at club level but Southgate prioritises what he sees during international training and matches. Pickford was injured for the first batch of World Cup qualifiers in March but, since his return, he has conceded only two goals in nine England starts. He was excellent at the Euros. Jordans calmness in the matches  in the last six months especially  has been a real standout and a progression, Southgate says. Its never been an issue in our games but generally, across the board, its an area hes paid attention to. Hes certainly seen the rewards of that. Pickfords shot-stopping and distribution have long marked him out but he has finessed the latter to appear more complete. The biggest thing is decision making  making the right pass at the right time  if its a counterattack or whether I need to take the sting out of the game and give the lads a breather, he says. If Im in charge of the ball, I need to manage the game. Thats what Ive improved on most. England are in what must be called a good moment and Southgate smiled when it was put to him that things might even be going a little too well. Where previously there has been hope, there is now the expectation of success and nobody in the setup seems fearful of saying they are in the World Cup to win it. Consider how the team has defended in the last 25 games  going back to October 2019. It is only seven goals conceded and here is the platform, the basis for the optimism. Pickford will keep on pushing.

Labor has accused Angus Taylor of attempting to repeat past climate scare campaigns and called on the energy minister to release government modelling that he claims shows electricity price rises would have a devastating impact if Labor is elected. News Corp tabloids on Tuesday published stories on their front pages claiming government modelling showed consumers would on average be $560 a year worse off by 2032-33 under an ALP policy to accelerate the construction of new electricity transmission links. Taylor, who is also the emissions reduction minister, issued a press release making the same claim, but the statement did not explain how the numbers were reached or who did the analysis. His office did not respond to a request for the modelling on Tuesday morning. Chris Bowen, ALPs climate change and energy spokesman, said the government release was a desperate attack and just the latest in more than a decade of climate scare campaigns from the Liberals. Labors policy is to create a $20bn rewiring the nation corporation charged with making decisions on new transmission links to allow a faster influx of large-scale solar, wind and batteries in regional renewable energy zones. Bowen announced on Saturday he had tested positive for Covid-19, and was not available for broadcast media interviews on Tuesday. In a statement he said the Coalitions attack showed it did not believe solar and wind were the cheapest form of energy, or that the worlds climate emergency was Australias jobs opportunity. It also shows that the Morrison governments last-minute conversion to net zero is a fraud, he said. If the Morrison government is so proud of its so-called modelling it should release it publicly for scrutiny, not selectively quote from it and keep it locked away. Where is the modelling? Who conducted it? What are its assumptions? Taylor said Labor wanted to gold-plate Australias electricity grid by bringing forward 11 pieces of energy infrastructure that would lead to the cost of poles and wires  which make up nearly 50% of consumer bills  increasing significantly. He said only two of the 11  the Marinus link between Tasmania and Victoria and the KerangLink between Victoria and New South Wales had been considered actionable by the Australian Electricity Market Operator. Experts say electricity prices are likely to be volatile and potentially increase whoever is in power after the 21 May election. Wholesale power prices  which make up about a third of consumer bills  have soared in recent weeks, in part due to coal power plant outages and the cost of gas power increasing following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Danny Price, managing director of Frontier Economics, said he had no involvement in the government modelling. He said he believed modelling for Labor by the consultants RepuTex that suggested power prices would fall as the grid was transformed was ridiculous, but that an additional $20bn of network investment would be required whoever was in power. He said the governments analysis appeared a response to Labor claiming its policy would unlock an additional $58bn of electricity investment, but it was unclear that this was really additional investment beyond what would happen anyway. In reality, Labors policy may just bring forward investment. He said the ALP and RepuTex had been unclear about this. Price said wind and solar generated electricity more cheaply than fossil fuels, but the cost of building new assets  a lot more solar and wind supported by firming power, including batteries, and transmission lines  to replace the countrys ageing coal plants would be required in any case to meet the bipartisan target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The big difference is how quickly you get there and how well you do the transition. Labor wants to get there more quickly than the government and that increases the costs sooner. But either way the costs are going to go up, Price said. Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, was quoted in the government press release as last year saying he was sceptical of any claim that more transmission equals lower prices. He told Guardian Australia he maintained this position but he had also been sharply critical of the Coalitions energy policies. He said there was an overwhelming case that localised batteries were the best way to drive a cheap transition to clean energy, and both major parties should leave direct intervention in electricity networks to state governments. I think the case for direct intervention by the federal government is weak. The evidence of it not going well under the current government is manifest, he said. I think we should not be making the problem worse. Tony Wood, energy program director with the Grattan Institute, was quoted in Taylors press release saying last year it was hard to see how the numbers would deliver the savings they [Labor] suggest. He said he stood by the statement, but accepted that Labors proposal to bring forward investment that would have happened anyway at a lower cost of capital could deliver some savings. He said both major parties were guilty of basing policy decisions on scenarios from economic models, rather than just using the modelling as an indicative guide, and that will almost always be bad policy because the model will always be wrong. Bowen said RepuTex were the countrys top energy economists and the government had also used them to model the electricity market.

The big difference is how quickly you get there and how well you do the transition. Labor wants to get there more quickly than the government and that increases the costs sooner. But either way the costs are going to go up, Price said. Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, was quoted in the government press release as last year saying he was sceptical of any claim that more transmission equals lower prices. He told Guardian Australia he maintained this position but he had also been sharply critical of the Coalitions energy policies. He said there was an overwhelming case that localised batteries were the best way to drive a cheap transition to clean energy, and both major parties should leave direct intervention in electricity networks to state governments. I think the case for direct intervention by the federal government is weak. The evidence of it not going well under the current government is manifest, he said. I think we should not be making the problem worse. Tony Wood, energy program director with the Grattan Institute, was quoted in Taylors press release saying last year it was hard to see how the numbers would deliver the savings they [Labor] suggest. He said he stood by the statement, but accepted that Labors proposal to bring forward investment that would have happened anyway at a lower cost of capital could deliver some savings. He said both major parties were guilty of basing policy decisions on scenarios from economic models, rather than just using the modelling as an indicative guide, and that will almost always be bad policy because the model will always be wrong. Bowen said RepuTex were the countrys top energy economists and the government had also used them to model the electricity market.

My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.

My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel.

Name: The Communist Manifesto. Age: 173 years. Remind me what it is again. A pamphlet by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels first published in 1848. I thought Marxism was dead  at least it seemed that way at the Labour party conference last week. Not so! Its never been hotter! Really? Yes! Even Grimes has been spotted reading a copy. The Canadian musician? Real name Claire Boucher? The one who had a baby with Elon Musk? The very same. In her first public appearance since her reported split with Musk  the richest man in the world, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX  she was photographed wearing a fantasy-themed outfit on a street corner in that hotbed of communism, Los Angeles. Is she a Marxist? No. The whole thing was staged; she tweeted that she had done the stunt to spark ridiculous headlines. Even more ridiculous headlines than calling your child X  A-Xii? One assumes so, yes. Is it a case of her hilariously trolling her definitely-not-a-communist ex? Perhaps, although she did write on Instagram: Im still living with E and I am not a communist (although there are some very smart ideas in this book ). Remind me, what are those smart ideas? That human history was based on class struggles between the oppressors and the oppressed. And  to put it very simply  this was not good. Sounds a lot like my life in 2021. Quite, which is why it is having a bit of a moment. It is still one of the most influential political documents ever written, and its ideas do have a habit of popping up in times of economic and social crisis. Because it shows us how many of the problems in the world can be attributed to capitalist production, greed and property? Exactly. Check out the Pandora papers if you need more evidence. Or people hogging petrol. What does it say is the answer to all this then? Revolution, of course. And the elimination of social classes as well as the means to appropriate private property. Is this why young people keep saying: Eat the rich? Well, yes, huge numbers of young people are turning their backs on capitalism. Well, thats because they cant afford to get a toe on the property ladder. Whatever the reason, the Communist Manifesto is strangely popular right now. Last year, it was translated into Somali for the first time and theres even a site where you can teach your parrot to recite it. Do say: Workers of the world, unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains. Dont say: My Tesla shares are doing well.  This article was amended on 5 October 2021. A previous version incorrectly said the Communist Manifesto was published by Marx and Engels.

The Canadian musician? Real name Claire Boucher? The one who had a baby with Elon Musk? The very same. In her first public appearance since her reported split with Musk  the richest man in the world, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX  she was photographed wearing a fantasy-themed outfit on a street corner in that hotbed of communism, Los Angeles. Is she a Marxist? No. The whole thing was staged; she tweeted that she had done the stunt to spark ridiculous headlines. Even more ridiculous headlines than calling your child X  A-Xii? One assumes so, yes. Is it a case of her hilariously trolling her definitely-not-a-communist ex? Perhaps, although she did write on Instagram: Im still living with E and I am not a communist (although there are some very smart ideas in this book ). Remind me, what are those smart ideas? That human history was based on class struggles between the oppressors and the oppressed. And  to put it very simply  this was not good. Sounds a lot like my life in 2021.

My father, Alan Ward, who has died aged 96, was a physicist who profoundly influenced science education in Africa. Born in Woodford, Essex, to Ursula (nee Vale) and Edward Ward, who worked in a bank, Alan went to Chichester high school for boys in West Sussex. Following a wartime degree in physics at the University of Birmingham, he completed a PhD in 1949, after which he was sent by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment to study Thorotrast poisoning in Denmark for two years. He married Honor Shedden, also a physicist, in 1950. The following year he took up a lectureship at the University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana), becoming associate professor in 1963. There he set up a radioactivity laboratory, supported by the Radiochemical Centre in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and conducted experiments that established the toxicity of Strontium-90, an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons. Alan built an international network of scientists involved in peaceful uses of radioactivity, and was part of the Atoms for Peace Geneva conference in 1958. His work expanded into using nuclear markers for agriculture and health. When France set off a nuclear device in Algeria in 1960, he proved the extent of radioactive fallout in Ghana, and provided insights into the impacts on the local population. This resulted in an irate French government sending in an army officer to verify the findings. Ward presented his findings to President Nkrumah, contributing to Ghana breaking off diplomatic relations with France. In the early 1960s Alan used information from contacts at Cern and the International Atomic Energy Agency to suggest that a proposed Soviet nuclear research project at Kwabenya in Ghana was deeply unwise. His warning upset Nkrumah, and as a result he was asked to leave the country in 1965. For the next 10 years he worked at the University of Zambia in Lusaka, founding a physics department there. He then moved to the Kwaluseni campus of the University of Botswana and Swaziland, lecturing there until 1986. Throughout their careers, both Alan and Honor played an active role in developing science education, teaching physics at all levels, and supporting the development of applied physics infrastructure in Africa. Their Christian faith was always at the centre of their lives. Both were quiet but vociferous opponents of racist and colonial attitudes and expressed their aspiration to make themselves redundant. In 1976, Alan was made OBE. He retired to the village of Hermitage, in Dorset, in 1986, where he worked for the Open University and the University of the Third Age, became chair of the Battery Vehicle Society, and built electric vehicles both for the road and for his grandchildren to drive in the garden. Honor died in 2016. Alan is survived by their children, Kristina, Sheena, James and me, nine grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

After Declan Rice, who was sent on by David Moyes at half-time to bring some order to an abject performance, struck in second-half stoppage time to take the game to extra time, Jarrod Bowen prevented penalties after snaffling a winner with 13 seconds left on the clock. Moyes, hands in pockets, was unmoved. The Kidderminster manager, Russell Penn, could only pull his snood over his face, while his assistant, Jimmy OConnor, swivelled on the touchline in disbelief. West Ham got out of jail to avoid an embarrassing exit and burst sixth-tier Kidderminsters bubble, after Alex Penny had sparked delirium by opening the scoring. For Kidderminster, an extraordinary journey that began against Sporting Khalsa in the second qualifying round and took in a third qualifying round replay against Ware came to an agonising finish, having outlasted Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle. They will resume their National League North promotion push and on Tuesday face a Worcestershire Senior Cup semi-final, though those that pushed West Ham all the way will get a breather, with this their ninth game in 28 days. I thought wed get blown away in extra time, but we didnt, Penn said. Im gutted for the lads. Theyre crawling around in the dressing room. They were piling the pressure on, but it was just unfortunate that they scored from the last phase of the game. We should take great heart from this and hopefully use it as a catalyst to push on. A couple of minutes before half time a punch-drunk Kidderminster fan gave the chairman, Richard Lane, who was stood behind the directors box taking everything in, a whopping kiss on the cheek. Seats were at a premium  tickets sold out within hours of going on sale  and after Sad Benrahma ballooned a wayward shot into the North Stand terrace, fans smelled a historic victory. West Ham had done their homework  one of Stuart Pearce or Alan Irvine attended Kidderminsters previous four games  but the first-half performance was laboured, disjointed and a pale imitation of the kind that has taken the visitors to fifth in the Premier League, 113 places above the hosts in the pyramid. Kidderminster instantly made their presence felt and Sam Austin forced Alphonse Areola, the on-loan Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper, to parry an early shot after a poor clearance by Ryan Fredericks, one of eight West Ham players promoted to the starting lineup. Areola, Bowen and Kurt Zouma kept their places but aside from Michail Antonio, who landed in London on Friday after international duty with Jamaica, a full-strength West Ham squad arrived in Worcestershire. But Moyes had to dip into his rich reserves sooner than planned. Rice was influential after entering at the break and with two minutes of stoppage time to play and Kidderminster close to an almighty upset, he took matters into his own hands, driving forward from halfway to source an equaliser. He played a one-two with Pablo Fornals, another substitute, cut inside Matt Preston, who otherwise had a faultless game in the Kidderminster defence, and smashed into the roof of the net. He is maturing as a player, Moyes said. Declan made a difference. He is having a bigger influence, a bigger impact. It is why I have said he is a special edition. We see him in that light. The selfless Amari Morgan-Smith proved too sleek for Issa Diop early on and moments after Omari Sterling-James snatched the ball from a dawdling Andriy Yarmolenko on halfway, the West Ham defender, who was replaced by Craig Dawson at half-time, conceded a foul. Sterling sent in the subsequent free-kick and Areola and Diop inadvertently collided after both attempting to beat Nathan Cameron to the ball. Diops headed clearance dropped kindly for the right-back Penny, who side-footed into an empty net. Cue pandemonium in the stands and on the touchline. Kidderminster were understandably deflated when Rice levelled but did not roll over. Caleb Richards intervened just as it seemed Bowen would prod home but West Ham, who had a goal disallowed for offside with 110 minutes on the clock, ratcheted up the pressure and, much to Kidderminsters pain, they still had a cruel winner left in the tank. Yarmolenkos shot pinballed in the box and dropped at the back post, where the substitute Aaron Cresswell squared for Bowen. It will be that one where the players say: How close were we? Penn said. It was a huge honour for me to be managing across from David Moyes. He said some lovely words. He said: Well done, we didnt deserve it.

Caleb Richards intervened just as it seemed Bowen would prod home but West Ham, who had a goal disallowed for offside with 110 minutes on the clock, ratcheted up the pressure and, much to Kidderminsters pain, they still had a cruel winner left in the tank. Yarmolenkos shot pinballed in the box and dropped at the back post, where the substitute Aaron Cresswell squared for Bowen. It will be that one where the players say: How close were we? Penn said. It was a huge honour for me to be managing across from David Moyes. He said some lovely words. He said: Well done, we didnt deserve it.

Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatchers government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. Its also about the insularity of the British abroad, said McKeand, blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loachs 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment  set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions. They agreed on Tim Healy and Kevin Whately to play the philosophising Dennis and the ever-homesick Neville, but were stuck on the casting for Oz, the tough character inspired by Connell. Their problem was solved when Jimmy Nail, who had a broken nose and several missing teeth, walked into the auditions. The septet was completed by Timothy Spall as the boring West Midlands electrician Barry, Gary Holton as the womanising cockney carpenter Wayne, Pat Roach as the Bristolian bricklayer and ex-wrestler Bomber, and Christopher Fairbank as the Liverpudlian plasterer Moxey. It was a complicated production. While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Dsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the casts high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities. McKeand then became embroiled in the diplomatic row that followed the screening of Death of a Princess (1980), the drama-documentary he co-produced with the director Antony Thomas, for which he had helped to raise funding from half a dozen countries. After seeing its re-enactment of the public executions of a Saudi royal and her male lover, Saudi Arabia imposed sanctions and ejected Britains ambassador from Riyadh. The programme-makers also had to fight off attacks from Conservative politicians in parliament  and critics who condemned the drama-documentary style. Between making Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, McKeand was Saatchi &amp; Saatchis deputy head of television advertising (1988-89). He returned to TV to produce another comedy-drama by Clement and La Frenais, Full Stretch (1993), starring Kevin McNally as a former footballer running a struggling limousine-hire company, and the first series of Harry (1993), with Michael Elphick as an unscrupulous news agency reporter. McKeands 1965 marriage to Lorna Heaton ended in divorce. He then had a long-term relationship with Jill Forbes, who died in 2001. He is survived by the two children of his marriage, Kate and Richard, his stepson, Alex, and his sister, Janet.  James Martin McKeand, television producer and advertising executive, born 16 August 1935; died 21 January 2022  This article was amended on 3 April 2022. The character Barry from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet has been described as being either from Birmingham or from various towns in the West Midlands. Rather than a Brummie electrician, we have now described him as a West Midlands one.

Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatchers government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. Its also about the insularity of the British abroad, said McKeand, blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loachs 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment  set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions. They agreed on Tim Healy and Kevin Whately to play the philosophising Dennis and the ever-homesick Neville, but were stuck on the casting for Oz, the tough character inspired by Connell. Their problem was solved when Jimmy Nail, who had a broken nose and several missing teeth, walked into the auditions. The septet was completed by Timothy Spall as the boring West Midlands electrician Barry, Gary Holton as the womanising cockney carpenter Wayne, Pat Roach as the Bristolian bricklayer and ex-wrestler Bomber, and Christopher Fairbank as the Liverpudlian plasterer Moxey. It was a complicated production. While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Dsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the casts high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities.

Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatchers government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. Its also about the insularity of the British abroad, said McKeand, blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loachs 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment  set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions. They agreed on Tim Healy and Kevin Whately to play the philosophising Dennis and the ever-homesick Neville, but were stuck on the casting for Oz, the tough character inspired by Connell. Their problem was solved when Jimmy Nail, who had a broken nose and several missing teeth, walked into the auditions. The septet was completed by Timothy Spall as the boring West Midlands electrician Barry, Gary Holton as the womanising cockney carpenter Wayne, Pat Roach as the Bristolian bricklayer and ex-wrestler Bomber, and Christopher Fairbank as the Liverpudlian plasterer Moxey. It was a complicated production. While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Dsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the casts high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. I was called into the hotel managers office, recalled McKeand in an article for the programmes official fansite. He was told: In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave. McKeands diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producers problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nails career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young &amp; Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: For mash, get Smash. Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities.

Boris Becker will be considered for deportation, the Home Office has confirmed, as experts said the potential battle could set a legal precedent and Becker may have to represent himself in court if he wants to remain in the UK. Last week, the former tennis star was jailed for two years and six months for hiding millions of pounds worth of assets after being made bankrupt in June 2017. Becker, sentenced under the Insolvency Act, will serve half the full prison term. A Home Office spokesperson said that while it did not routinely comment on individual cases, any foreign national who is convicted of a crime and given a prison sentence is considered for deportation at the earliest opportunity. Such a development is likely to make case history because the Home Office may claim that Beckers criminal offences continued after the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on 31 December 2020, which made immigration law for EU citizens more stringent. This ambiguity means Becker, who is not thought to have taken British citizenship, could either be considered for deportation under the previous, more relaxed version of the UK Borders Act 2007, or the updated version, which was implemented on 31 December 2020. Fighting against it could cost up to 30,000, experts said, meaning Becker may have to represent himself in court as a litigant in person. If the criminal conduct took place after 31 December 2020 then Becker is subject to automatic deportation because he received a sentence of 12 months or more, said Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister and author of Welcome to Britain: Fixing Our Broken Immigration System. He could attempt to resist deportation on human rights grounds but we have seen young black men who have lived in the UK far longer than Becker, sometimes since early childhood, deported for lower sentences than Becker received. If the conduct took place before that date, he benefits from the protection of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement. He would still be considered for deportation and the Home Office would be likely to attempt to deport him but hed have a stronger legal case for staying. Christopher Cole, a consultant solicitor in immigration and asylum law for DG Legal, said Beckers was the first case he had seen that would test the new legal landscape. Its uncharted territory: Im not aware of any cases like this one, where the courts have had to decide which side of the dividing line the offending behaviour occurred, he said. If the court decides the offending behaviour continued until Beckers sentencing last week, the home secretary is likely to press on with an attempt to deport him, said Cole. More often than not, because of the political pressure on the Home Office, wherever possible they will try to make a decision to deport any foreign national offender even if it looks like theyve got a fairly weak case and theres a very high chance of that person succeeding on appeal, said Cole. Even if they think theyre almost bound to lose, more often than not they will make a decision to deport and that would then lead to an appeal to the tribunal. In this case, Becker will either have to find up to 30,000 or represent himself as a litigant in person, he added. Zeena Luchowa, a senior solicitor at Laura Devine Immigration and member of the Law Societys immigration committee, said if Beckers conduct was deemed to have been committed after 31 December 2020, a deportation can be made if deemed conducive to the public good. This gives discretion to the Home Office to act in a way that reflects the public interest  and given Home Offices position on criminality when it comes to foreign nationals they are unlikely to let this one go. Becker, she added, could appeal on human rights grounds or an application could be made for the deportation order to be revoked if compassionate circumstances were found. But appeals can typically take six to 12 months to be processed and are very expensive, said Leon Glenister, a barrister at Landmark Chambers. The presumption is that he will receive a deportation order but although one has to consider his right to a private and family life, I cant see that is going to give him much hope. Even if Becker goes to a high street lawyer to defend him, costs can reach 30,000. The only other option is for him to represent himself as a litigant in person. This is not unheard of but it can be quite complicated, so its not advised.

The ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis, should have been exterminated by now in the UK, hunted down and shot at a cost of roughly 3,000 a bird. If you see one you are supposed to report its position so it too can be eliminated. Peak numbers 20 years ago were 6,000 birds  that was down to 26 in 2018 and now there may be as few as 10 to 15. This is part of a Europe-wide programme aimed at preventing the enthusiastic males impregnating the closely related but endangered white-headed duck, Oxyura leucocephala, of southern Spain. That species was down to 22 birds in 1977 but thanks to careful conservation now numbers more than 2,500. The ruddy duck was brought to Slimbridge sanctuary in Gloucestershire in the 1940s from North America and thrived, with numbers growing steadily across Europe until the danger to white-headed ducks became apparent. In a rare spirit of European cooperation every colonised country agreed to a cull, aiming at total elimination. The British effort alone has cost 3.3m, mostly to hire the marksmen. It has been a controversial programme, with many nature lovers appalled at the idea of shooting sitting ducks on their nests. Some bird spotters have therefore been reluctant to report sightings, so there may still be some survivors.

Jrgen Klopp has demonstrated his faith in Caoimhn Kelleher by confirming the second-choice goalkeeper will start next months Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. Kelleher is Liverpools regular selection for this seasons competition and delivered another assured performance in Thursdays semi-final second-leg win at Arsenal. Despite the availability of Alisson, the best goalie in the world according to his manager, and Liverpools 10-year wait for domestic cup success, Klopp believes it is crucial for Kellehers long-term future at Anfield to have a starting role at Wembley on 27 February. Caoimhn will play, if he is fit, he said. As a football manager you have to consider a lot of things and one of the things is we consider Caoimhn an outstanding goalie. Not a good goalie, an outstanding goalie, and we want to keep him here. And to keep him you need to make sure of a few things. Before a season you need to think and talk about about the different games he will get. It is all about performing of course. If he didnt perform on the level he performed then I would maybe think differently. But he has shown he deserves all the trust and faith that we have in him. I didnt think about it properly, but my idea in this moment is to play him. I dont see any reason why we should not do that. Caoimhn deserves that. He brought the team there. Klopp credits Liverpools goalkeeping coach, John Achterberg, with turning a skinny boy from Ireland standing in this big goal to a mature and commanding 23-year-old Republic of Ireland international. Last week against Arsenal I had to explain to Caoimhn why he is not playing, Klopp said of the first leg. I usually do not do that, but it was his competition and I thought Ali needs the game because he was lacking rhythm after Covid. What I really liked was that Caoimhn was not like: Oh yes, I understand. He was: What? Why? So he matures in all departments. That is the goalie we want. This is really the John Achterberg project. When Caoimhn first came here there were not all the people in the club who thought: Caoimhn Kelleher will be the next goalkeeper. There was one person: John. If you have to buy this goalkeeper now then it is pretty expensive. Now we have the best in the world and a really, really good one. That is a good situation.

My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.

Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.

Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.

Aston Villa have signed Calum Chambers from Arsenal. The 27-year-old, who can play at centre-back or right-back, is the fourth arrival since Steven Gerrard took over as manager, joining midfielder Philippe Coutinho, the left-back Lucas Digne and the goalkeeper Robin Olsen. Chambers, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal, has made only five appearances this season, with three of those in the Carabao Cup and his most recent Premier League game coming in late August. The former Southampton player has been at Arsenal since 2014 and his deal was due to expire this summer. Arsenal said Chambers had moved for an undisclosed fee. Arsenal are close to a finalising deal to sign the goalkeeper Matt Turner from New England Revolution. The fee for the USA international will be about 6m with up to 2.5m in add-ons and he will join in the summer. Arsenal have agreed terms with the 27-year-old, who has played his whole career in the US and started 13 of his countrys 22 matches last year. Turner is viewed by Arsenal as cover for Aaron Ramsdale, who joined from Sheffield United last summer and has been preferred to Bernd Leno. Ramsdales form has restricted Leno to four cup appearances since late August and it appears a question of when, not if, the German leaves. Arsenal have also been pursuing the Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo but their proposal of a six-month loan for the Brazilian was turned down by the Italian club, who asked for any loan to last until the end of next season.

Newcastles new 22m midfielder Joe Willock is unable to face West Ham at St James Park on Sunday after failing to complete the formalities of his move from Arsenal in time. Steve Bruce had hoped to have Willock on the bench against David Moyess side but Newcastle missed the Premier Leagues 12pm registration deadline on Friday. Willocks fee could rise to 25m with add-ons. The 21-year-old, who scored eight goals for Newcastle during a loan last spring, is nonetheless delighted to have returned to Tyneside following several days of protracted negotiation over personal terms after a fee was agreed with Arsenal last Sunday. Im buzzing to be here, he said. I loved my time here last season and Im really happy to be back as a Newcastle United player. Leaving Arsenal is obviously a big step but this is the right move to the right club at the right time for me. I only got one chance to play in front of a small number of Newcastle fans as a home player last season so I cant wait to step out in front of a packed St James Park and sample that atmosphere. Bruce had devoted much of the summer to the pursuit of Willock and was suitably delighted by his arrival. Weve had to be patient and persistent but its been worth the wait to bring our No 1 target back here, he said After an even longer wait, Freddie Woodman will finally make his Premier League debut for Newcastle on Sunday. The 24-year-old goalkeeper, and godson of the England manager Gareth Southgate, has spent the past two seasons on loan at Swansea but with Newcastles first-choice keeper, Martin Dubravka, out with a foot injury and his deputy, Karl Darlow, struggling to recover from Covid, Bruce has confirmed Woodman will start. Freddie gets his chance, said Newcastles manager, who revealed Darlow had endured significant weight loss after recently spending five nights in hospital. Freddies waited patiently and its a big opportunity for him. Woodman had been poised to join Bournemouth on another loan when Darlow was admitted to hospital.

Newcastles new 22m midfielder Joe Willock is unable to face West Ham at St James Park on Sunday after failing to complete the formalities of his move from Arsenal in time. Steve Bruce had hoped to have Willock on the bench against David Moyess side but Newcastle missed the Premier Leagues 12pm registration deadline on Friday. Willocks fee could rise to 25m with add-ons. The 21-year-old, who scored eight goals for Newcastle during a loan last spring, is nonetheless delighted to have returned to Tyneside following several days of protracted negotiation over personal terms after a fee was agreed with Arsenal last Sunday. Im buzzing to be here, he said. I loved my time here last season and Im really happy to be back as a Newcastle United player. Leaving Arsenal is obviously a big step but this is the right move to the right club at the right time for me. I only got one chance to play in front of a small number of Newcastle fans as a home player last season so I cant wait to step out in front of a packed St James Park and sample that atmosphere. Bruce had devoted much of the summer to the pursuit of Willock and was suitably delighted by his arrival. Weve had to be patient and persistent but its been worth the wait to bring our No 1 target back here, he said After an even longer wait, Freddie Woodman will finally make his Premier League debut for Newcastle on Sunday. The 24-year-old goalkeeper, and godson of the England manager Gareth Southgate, has spent the past two seasons on loan at Swansea but with Newcastles first-choice keeper, Martin Dubravka, out with a foot injury and his deputy, Karl Darlow, struggling to recover from Covid, Bruce has confirmed Woodman will start. Freddie gets his chance, said Newcastles manager, who revealed Darlow had endured significant weight loss after recently spending five nights in hospital. Freddies waited patiently and its a big opportunity for him. Woodman had been poised to join Bournemouth on another loan when Darlow was admitted to hospital.

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork.

He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three.

Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth.

I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough.

Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72.

Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams.

All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes.

Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles.

What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand.

This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly.

Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

The $75bn takeover of Cambridge-based chip designer Arm by its rival Nvidia is in jeopardy after US regulators followed the UK and Europe in moving to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to stop the takeover of Arm, which has ballooned in value from $40bn to $75bn since the offer was made last September due to a stock market surge in the chip sector, as seemingly almost insurmountable opposition now mounts after regulator action in Europe and the UK. The FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation pipeline for next-generation technologies, said Holly Vedova, bureau of competition director at the FTC. This proposed deal would distort Arms incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidias rivals. The FTC, which now poses the biggest threat to scuppering California-based Nvidias takeover, said that the lawsuit should send a strong signal that we will act aggressively to protect our critical infrastructure markets from illegal vertical mergers. The US is the latest market to raise concerns about the merger as countries around the world increasingly focus on the ramifications of takeovers that threaten national security and infrastructure firms in the tech industry. The increasingly severe global shortage of chips  the brain within every electronic device in the world, from smartphones and iPads to cars and smart TVs  has increased takeover activity and sharpened the focus of regulators. The proposed vertical deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing technology and designs that rivals rely on to develop their own competing chips, the FTC said. Arm, which employs 6,500 staff, including 3,000 in the UK, has been described as the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, with its designs used by suppliers including rivals of Nvidia. Arm, whose acquisition by Japanese group SoftBank for $32bn in 2016 raised no regulatory issues, has more than 500 clients who use its designs and compete globally including Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm. Nvidia, which has pledged not to downsize Arms UK operations and to keep its open licensing model, said the deal would help accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation, including in the UK. The FTC, whose commission voted unanimously to take action and said it had cooperated with competition agencies in the European Union, UK, Japan and South Korea, disagreed. The proposed merger would give Nvidia the ability and incentive to use its control of this technology to undermine competitors, said the FTC. [It would] reduce competition and ultimately result in reduced product quality, reduced innovation, higher prices, and less choice. Last month, the UK government ordered an in-depth investigation into Nvidias takeover. Nadine Dorries, the digital and culture secretary, said Arm had a unique place in the global technology supply chain. The governments intervention followed the Competition and Markets Authoritys initial findings in July that the deal raised serious competition concerns, and the regulators assessment that no behavioural remedy offered by Nvidia would be enough to address them. Despite the mounting obstacles to the deal, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of seller SoftBank, said last month that he expected the takeover to eventually be cleared.

Last month, the UK government ordered an in-depth investigation into Nvidias takeover.

The governments intervention followed the Competition and Markets Authoritys initial findings in July that the deal raised serious competition concerns, and the regulators assessment that no behavioural remedy offered by Nvidia would be enough to address them.

The $75bn takeover of Cambridge-based chip designer Arm by its rival Nvidia is in jeopardy after US regulators followed the UK and Europe in moving to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to stop the takeover of Arm, which has ballooned in value from $40bn to $75bn since the offer was made last September due to a stock market surge in the chip sector, as seemingly almost insurmountable opposition now mounts after regulator action in Europe and the UK. The FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation pipeline for next-generation technologies, said Holly Vedova, bureau of competition director at the FTC. This proposed deal would distort Arms incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidias rivals. The FTC, which now poses the biggest threat to scuppering California-based Nvidias takeover, said that the lawsuit should send a strong signal that we will act aggressively to protect our critical infrastructure markets from illegal vertical mergers. The US is the latest market to raise concerns about the merger as countries around the world increasingly focus on the ramifications of takeovers that threaten national security and infrastructure firms in the tech industry. The increasingly severe global shortage of chips  the brain within every electronic device in the world, from smartphones and iPads to cars and smart TVs  has increased takeover activity and sharpened the focus of regulators. The proposed vertical deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing technology and designs that rivals rely on to develop their own competing chips, the FTC said. Arm, which employs 6,500 staff, including 3,000 in the UK, has been described as the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, with its designs used by suppliers including rivals of Nvidia. Arm, whose acquisition by Japanese group SoftBank for $32bn in 2016 raised no regulatory issues, has more than 500 clients who use its designs and compete globally including Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm. Nvidia, which has pledged not to downsize Arms UK operations and to keep its open licensing model, said the deal would help accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation, including in the UK. The FTC, whose commission voted unanimously to take action and said it had cooperated with competition agencies in the European Union, UK, Japan and South Korea, disagreed. The proposed merger would give Nvidia the ability and incentive to use its control of this technology to undermine competitors, said the FTC. [It would] reduce competition and ultimately result in reduced product quality, reduced innovation, higher prices, and less choice.

Kevin McCarthy, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, privately accused one of his colleagues of putting people in jeopardy in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, according to a leaked audio recording. In a phone call with Republican leaders on 10 January 2021, McCarthy said that Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman and ardent Trump supporter, was putting Americans at risk with his comments after the assault on the US Capitol that left five people dead. The New York Times obtained a recording of the call, in which McCarthy and Republicans including Steve Scalise, the No 2 House Republican, discussed an interview Gaetz had given where he attacked GOP members who had criticized Trump. Hes putting people in jeopardy, McCarthy said of Gaetz. And he doesnt need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else. In the days after the insurrection McCarthy strongly criticized Trump, saying: The president bears responsibility for Wednesdays attack on Congress by mob rioters. Since then McCarthy has defended Trumps actions, suggesting Trump was unaware that the riot was taking place. In the 10 January call McCarthy also called out Mo Brooks, a congressman from Alabama who at a rally before Trump supporters attacked the Capitol said: Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass. You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments? McCarthy asked those on the call. Thats almost something that goes further than what the president said. Discussing the statements and actions of some Republicans, McCarthy said: Our members have got to start paying attention to what they say, too, and you cant put up with that type of shit. Lauren Boebert, a congresswoman from Colorado, and Barry Moore from Alabama, were among the other GOP members named in the call. Boebert has been a staunch defender of Trumps actions that day. Tension is too high, the country is too crazy, I do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt, McCarthy said in the call.

The band Im in is on its first tour in three years, and were now rolling to its conclusion  Stamford, Liverpool, Oxford and on, 13 dates in all. When youre on the road for a stretch, the question of how and when you eat becomes a matter of profound interest, and eventually concern. Some venues feed you  vegetarian curry at a boardroom table on the top floor of an arts centre. Others send you to an adjacent pub. Mostly, the venue gives you a tenner each and leaves you to it  but the brief period between sound check and performance doesnt leave much time to source and eat supper, especially if youre unfamiliar with the area. The venue in Cambridge is part of a complex that includes half a dozen fast-food outlets. The abundance of options is a little overwhelming. Eventually one contingent peels off toward a noodle bar. The accordion player and I opt for overpriced burgers. I think Im gonna get a pizza, the bass player says, pointing to a place across the way. When we meet him in the square a few minutes later, he has no food. They said it takes 20 minutes, he says. Thats cutting it fine, I say, unhelpfully. Theyve already had my money, he says. The accordion player and I head back to the dressing room. By the time the bass player arrives, looking harried, we have finished eating. Im copying out our set list in huge block letters, so Ill able to read it without my glasses. The bass player puts his pizza box on the table and goes out to hang up his coat. Im exhausted and confused, I say. No one answers. The bass player sits down in front of his pizza. I glance up as he lifts the lid and there, in the middle of it, sits a medium-sized orange. Theres an orange in the middle of your pizza, I say. I know, the bass player says. Why is there an orange on your pizza? the accordion player says. The guy put it there, says the bass player, scowling. Did you order it that way? I say. No, he says. Its just to stop the box crushing the pizza. This seems fanciful to me, until I remember there is such a thing as a pizza box support  a little plastic dolls house table. Still, Im outraged. Does he use a new orange every time? I say. What a waste! Or do some people get, like, a hard-boiled egg? says the accordion player. Its just an orange, the bass player says, removing it carefully. Why not use an onion? I say. Or a tennis ball? Or an iPhone charger? says the accordion player. I dont work there, the bass player says. You should take that orange back, I say, and complain. The drummer leans into the doorway. Ten minutes, he says. On stage, even while playing, I cant stop thinking about the orange. I am perplexed by the incongruity, excess and sheer lack of sense behind it. I dont know how much a big box of those little plastic pizza box tables costs, but it cant be more than 500 oranges. In the interval, I am standing behind our merchandise stall when a woman approaches. She tells me that she came with her friend Angela, a huge fan of the band. They drove down from Scotland, she tells me, just so Angela could get her hands on one of our souvenir mugs. Wow, I say. She asks if I might consider dedicating a song to Angela in the second set. Of course, I say. Otherwise, she says, its a long way to come for a fucking cup. Afterwards, we pack and load our equipment quickly, then return to the dressing room, discussing the evening as we change out of sweaty shirts. All the way from Scotland! says the accordion player. I know, I say. Think of the petrol. The bass player walks in, looking for his coat. Just for a mug, the accordion player says. Its the weirdest thing, I say. The bass player walks out again. No, the weirdest thing, the accordion player says, indicating the exiting bass player, is that he still has no idea I put that orange on his pizza. This column is dedicated to Angela.

The Oscar and Grammy-winning songwriter Leslie Bricusse has died at the age of 90. London-born Bricusse was known for writing the lyrics for the theme to James Bond adventure Goldfinger as well as songs for films including Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Doctor Dolittle. His son Adam Bricusse announced news of his death on social media, saying he passed away peacefully. His close friend Joan Collins also posted on Instagram, paying tribute to one of the giant songwriters of our time. Bricusse won a best song Oscar for writing Talk to the Animals from 1967s Doctor Dolittle as well as one for best adaptation and original song score (later retitled best original score) for 1982s Victor/Victoria. Some of his best-known work comes from 1971s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, with Bricusse writing both Candy Man and Pure Imagination alongside Anthony Newley. On the next soundstage, they were shooting Cabaret, Bricusse said of the production in an interview from June this year. And I thought how wonderful it was. And I was a bit nervous about the amateur style of our show compared with the professionalism of Bob Fosse. Bricusse also collaborated with John Barry for the themes to Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice. His stage work included 1989s Sherlock Holmes: The Musical and 1961s Stop the World  I Want to Get Off with Newley. Their song What Kind of Fool Am I?, from the latter musical, made them the first Brits to ever win the song of the year Grammy in 1963. The pair also wrote the song Feeling Good for the musical The Roar of the Greasepaint  The Smell of the Crowd, which was later made famous by Nina Simone. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989. Tributes have also been paid by stars including Elaine Paige on Twitter. Shocked &amp; saddened by the news that the brilliant &amp; wonderful Leslie Bricusse has died, she wrote. One of our great songwriters. My first ever professional role was in Roar of the Greasepaint musical. Weve been friends for many years. Andrew Lloyd Webber released a statement, calling Bricusse the most underestimated British songwriter of all time. When talking of Pure Imagination earlier this year, Bricusse said: Its a good thought for people, especially young people, to carry with them through life. Youll be free if you truly wish to be at the end is, to me, the most important line in the film. Its a reflective thought on how to make a life work. He is survived by his son Adam and wife, the actor Yvonne Romain.

Ralf Rangnick said the referees failure to award a free-kick in the buildup to Atltico Madrids winner was decisive as Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League last 16. Renan Lodis 41st-minute strike means it will be at least five seasons since United last won a trophy. The goal occurred after a coming together of Anthony Elanga and Reinildo Mandava, with the referee, Slavko Vinic, judging there was no foul. Rangnick said: There were some curious refereeing decisions, I wouldnt necessarily say decisive  maybe the one they scored. I believe it was a foul on Anthony Elanga, the referee and linesman didnt see it that way. He [Vinic] made it pretty easy for Atltico to do their time-wasting antics and it didnt make it any easier for us. In the second half, I dont know if the game was played for more than two minutes without being interrupted with someone lying on the floor. Rangnick was asked if his players had failed to turn up for their biggest game of the season. We didnt score, thats true. We played a good first half, all those things that we planned to do in the first half the team did. The only thing we didnt achieve is to convert that energetic performance into the first goal and against a team like Atltico its highly important you score the first goal. And its more important not to concede a goal and we conceded just before half-time in a transitional moment. We shouldnt have been 1-0 down at half-time, we were the better team in the first half. Its important to score first  even more so against a team like Atltico. David de Gea was asked about Uniteds trophy drought. Youre right  too many years without any trophies  that we are fighting for trophies, the goalkeeper said. So I think we need to be clear: that we want to achieve good things, fight for trophies, we dont just want to play for the top four, and be there, get out of the Champions League [early]. We need much more from everyone because this club is too big for where we are now. We are far from fighting places for the Premier League and Champions League. At the final whistle Diego Simeone had objects thrown at him by fans as Atlticos manager ran towards the tunnel, though he was unaware of this. I dont know what happened, he said. United will now focus on Champions League qualification via a top-four finish. Rangnicks team are fifth on 50 points, one behind Arsenal who have three games in hand. We must try and win most of our last nine games, the interim manager said.

Ralf Rangnick said the referees failure to award a free-kick in the buildup to Atltico Madrids winner was decisive as Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League last 16. Renan Lodis 41st-minute strike means it will be at least five seasons since United last won a trophy. The goal occurred after a coming together of Anthony Elanga and Reinildo Mandava, with the referee, Slavko Vinic, judging there was no foul. Rangnick said: There were some curious refereeing decisions, I wouldnt necessarily say decisive  maybe the one they scored. I believe it was a foul on Anthony Elanga, the referee and linesman didnt see it that way. He [Vinic] made it pretty easy for Atltico to do their time-wasting antics and it didnt make it any easier for us. In the second half, I dont know if the game was played for more than two minutes without being interrupted with someone lying on the floor. Rangnick was asked if his players had failed to turn up for their biggest game of the season. We didnt score, thats true. We played a good first half, all those things that we planned to do in the first half the team did. The only thing we didnt achieve is to convert that energetic performance into the first goal and against a team like Atltico its highly important you score the first goal. And its more important not to concede a goal and we conceded just before half-time in a transitional moment. We shouldnt have been 1-0 down at half-time, we were the better team in the first half. Its important to score first  even more so against a team like Atltico. David de Gea was asked about Uniteds trophy drought. Youre right  too many years without any trophies  that we are fighting for trophies, the goalkeeper said. So I think we need to be clear: that we want to achieve good things, fight for trophies, we dont just want to play for the top four, and be there, get out of the Champions League [early]. We need much more from everyone because this club is too big for where we are now. We are far from fighting places for the Premier League and Champions League. At the final whistle Diego Simeone had objects thrown at him by fans as Atlticos manager ran towards the tunnel, though he was unaware of this. I dont know what happened, he said. United will now focus on Champions League qualification via a top-four finish. Rangnicks team are fifth on 50 points, one behind Arsenal who have three games in hand. We must try and win most of our last nine games, the interim manager said.

The footballer Emiliano Sala was put under pressure to complete his multimillion-pound transfer to the Premier League before he died in a plane crash as he headed to his new club, an inquest jury has been told. Salas mother, Mercedes Taffarel, said the weeks before the private plane he was in crashed into the Channel as he travelled from Nantes in France to join Cardiff City seemed very intense. Cardiff put on a lot of pressure on him to complete the sale quickly, but Nantes asked for more money and Emi felt in the middle of the dispute, she said. Emi was in some doubt to go ahead with the move. Finally, the sale was agreed, not because of his performances as a player at Nantes, which were very good, but because Nantes needed the money. The Argentina-born striker was joining the then Premier League club from the French Ligue 1 side Nantes in a 15m deal. Dorset coroners court heard that the 28-year-old died when the plane crashed close to Guernsey on 21 January 2019. The body of the pilot, David Ibbotson, has never been found. On the first day of the inquest, Salas mother told the court that her sons dream since childhood in Argentina had been to become a professional footballer. When she first took him to play, the family could not afford to buy him football boots so he trained in trainers, but he loved the game and thrived. In a written statement, Taffarel said his goalscoring exploits in France led to calls for him to be called up to Argentinas national team. He appreciated the Nantes club and the fans very much, she said. An offer came in from Cardiff City in December 2018. It is true to say that Emi was very happy when he eventually accepted the idea of the move as he had the chance to play in the Premier League. He felt it was the right time to move clubs and to another league. It seemed to him that the Nantes management was also pushing his exit from the club because they were going through some financial problems. Emis transfer was the most expensive in history of the club and that also helped to push forward his transfer, even though the team coach didnt want him to leave the club. Taffarel said she spoke to her son regularly, and when she did not hear from him on the day of the flight she assumed he had gone to bed early after arriving in Wales. The following day she learned that the plane was missing. Relatives travelled to Guernsey. In the cold weather we walked on those islands calling his name, hoping to hear from him, she said. Taffarel spoke of the familys trauma when the official search was eventually called off. It was extremely distressing. We didnt hesitate to hire a private team to continue. The plane was located with Salas body inside. She said: No one can bring Emi back to us, but we ask for justice so that Emi can rest in peace and give us a little bit of peace of mind knowing that we did everything we could so similar deaths are prevented in the future. The inquest, which is taking place at the town hall in Bournemouth, is due to last about five weeks.

Salas mother, Mercedes Taffarel, said the weeks before the private plane he was in crashed into the Channel as he travelled from Nantes in France to join Cardiff City seemed very intense. Cardiff put on a lot of pressure on him to complete the sale quickly, but Nantes asked for more money and Emi felt in the middle of the dispute, she said. Emi was in some doubt to go ahead with the move. Finally, the sale was agreed, not because of his performances as a player at Nantes, which were very good, but because Nantes needed the money. The Argentina-born striker was joining the then Premier League club from the French Ligue 1 side Nantes in a 15m deal. Dorset coroners court heard that the 28-year-old died when the plane crashed close to Guernsey on 21 January 2019. The body of the pilot, David Ibbotson, has never been found. On the first day of the inquest, Salas mother told the court that her sons dream since childhood in Argentina had been to become a professional footballer. When she first took him to play, the family could not afford to buy him football boots so he trained in trainers, but he loved the game and thrived. In a written statement, Taffarel said his goalscoring exploits in France led to calls for him to be called up to Argentinas national team. He appreciated the Nantes club and the fans very much, she said. An offer came in from Cardiff City in December 2018. It is true to say that Emi was very happy when he eventually accepted the idea of the move as he had the chance to play in the Premier League. He felt it was the right time to move clubs and to another league. It seemed to him that the Nantes management was also pushing his exit from the club because they were going through some financial problems. Emis transfer was the most expensive in history of the club and that also helped to push forward his transfer, even though the team coach didnt want him to leave the club. Taffarel said she spoke to her son regularly, and when she did not hear from him on the day of the flight she assumed he had gone to bed early after arriving in Wales. The following day she learned that the plane was missing. Relatives travelled to Guernsey. In the cold weather we walked on those islands calling his name, hoping to hear from him, she said. Taffarel spoke of the familys trauma when the official search was eventually called off. It was extremely distressing. We didnt hesitate to hire a private team to continue. The plane was located with Salas body inside. She said: No one can bring Emi back to us, but we ask for justice so that Emi can rest in peace and give us a little bit of peace of mind knowing that we did everything we could so similar deaths are prevented in the future. The inquest, which is taking place at the town hall in Bournemouth, is due to last about five weeks.

The Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy has appeared in court to face a new allegation of attempted rape. Mendy, who appeared in the dock at Chester crown court, is now accused of nine offences relating to six alleged victims. A judge ruled that the new charge, one of attempted rape involving a new complainant, could be reported. The France international spoke only to confirm his identity and leaned his head towards a French interpreter who sat between him and his co-defendant, Louis Saha Matturie. Mendy, 27, of Prestbury, Cheshire, is accused of offences including seven counts of rape relating to four women, one of sexual assault and the latest charge. Mendy joined City from Monaco in 2017 for a reported 52m, then a record fee for a defender, and has made 75 appearances. The club suspended him after he was charged. Matturie, 40, of Eccles, Salford, is accused of 10 offences, involving seven women, including seven counts of rape relating to five women and three of sexual assault. All the charges span from late 2020 to August 2021. Both defendants were given bail in January. Judge Patrick Thompson set a further pre-trial hearing for 11 March.

Rafael Bentez has said the Premier Leagues profit and sustainability rules killed Everton this summer but he is satisfied with his first transfer window at Goodison Park. Everton signed five players but paid only one fee, a cut-price 1.7m for Demarai Gray, as they strived to reduce losses that have totalled almost 265m in the past three financial years. Premier League rules allow for a 105m loss in a three-year period, although last years figures were relaxed because of the pandemic. The club was unable to secure a right-back, with offers for Rangers Nathan Patterson and Arsenals Ainsley Maitland-Niles rejected, and a move for Portos winger Luis Daz also failed to bear fruit. Manchester Uniteds midfielder Donny van de Beek was offered to Everton in the final days of the window but the deal was not easy for us, according to Bentez. However, having signed Salomn Rondn on deadline day, the striker joining fellow free transfers Andros Townsend, Asmir Begovic and Andy Lonergan, the Everton manager believes the club worked well within its financial constraints. I am really happy with the players we brought in because they are the players we needed and they know what we are looking for, Bentez said. The commitment of these players is very clear for everyone to see. We didnt spend a lot of money but we made some good signings. Could it be better? Yes, because if you have more money you can do it, but the financial fair play rules were killing us in this window. Hopefully in the next window it will be different but Im really pleased because the players we brought are players we needed. Maybe we needed more players in certain positions but I think we did quite well. Portos reluctance to re-sign James Rodrguez complicated the move for Diaz and the playmaker, who earns 200,000 a week, rejected interest from Istanbul Basaksehir. Bentez admits the failure to move players on was a complication. To bring players in it was important for us to create some space for other players. We couldnt do it and now we have to manage that.

Rafael Bentez has said the Premier Leagues profit and sustainability rules killed Everton this summer but he is satisfied with his first transfer window at Goodison Park. Everton signed five players but paid only one fee, a cut-price 1.7m for Demarai Gray, as they strived to reduce losses that have totalled almost 265m in the past three financial years. Premier League rules allow for a 105m loss in a three-year period, although last years figures were relaxed because of the pandemic. The club was unable to secure a right-back, with offers for Rangers Nathan Patterson and Arsenals Ainsley Maitland-Niles rejected, and a move for Portos winger Luis Daz also failed to bear fruit. Manchester Uniteds midfielder Donny van de Beek was offered to Everton in the final days of the window but the deal was not easy for us, according to Bentez. However, having signed Salomn Rondn on deadline day, the striker joining fellow free transfers Andros Townsend, Asmir Begovic and Andy Lonergan, the Everton manager believes the club worked well within its financial constraints. I am really happy with the players we brought in because they are the players we needed and they know what we are looking for, Bentez said. The commitment of these players is very clear for everyone to see. We didnt spend a lot of money but we made some good signings. Could it be better? Yes, because if you have more money you can do it, but the financial fair play rules were killing us in this window. Hopefully in the next window it will be different but Im really pleased because the players we brought are players we needed. Maybe we needed more players in certain positions but I think we did quite well.

The foster mother of missing child William Tyrrell provided a NSW Crime Commission hearing about the boys disappearance with false or misleading information, police have alleged. On Thursday, detectives from strike force Rosann  which was established to investigate Tyrrells disappearance  issued a 56-year-old woman with a court attendance notice. The woman  understood to be Tyrrells foster mother  will have her matter heard at Sydneys Downing Centre local court on 24 May. William Tyrrell was last seen playing at his foster grandmothers home in northern New South Wales in September 2014, when he was three years old. Thursdays charge is the latest in a string of recent developments linked to the investigation. In a statement released on Thursday, NSW police said the woman was charged with knowingly giving false or misleading evidence. Guardian Australia understands this occurred at a hearing before the NSW Crime Commission  a body that works alongside police to investigate serious crimes. She remains before the courts, the police statement said. Investigations under strike force Rosann continue. A years-long investigation into Tyrrells disappearance  which included digging up key sites in the town he was last seen in at the end of last year  continues. His disappearance was also the subject of a coronial inquest. In March, a man understood to be Tyrrells foster father was charged with a similar allegation in relation to information he provided to the NSW Crime Commission. He has already pleaded not guilty to the charges. Neither of the foster parents can be named for legal reasons. In a separate matter unrelated to the NSW Crime Commission charges, the foster parents were last year charged with the alleged common assault of a child who was not William Tyrrell. They both pleaded not guilty. The charges are not connected to Tyrells disappearance.

Thomas Tuchel said that nothing will change for him after Roman Abramovich passed stewardship of Chelsea to trustees of the clubs charitable foundation. Tuchel, who also defended his decision to bring on Kepa Arrizabalaga for penalties in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday,on Sunday, which they then lost 11-10, insisted he is not concerned after a weekend of drama at Chelsea. Abramovichs move to relinquish the running of Chelsea came after a call in parliament for him to be sanctioned and was said to have been provoked by the growing focus on him following Russias invasion of Ukraine. However the Russian, who announced the move on Saturday evening, remains Chelseas owner and the clubs leadership structure has not altered significantly. The charitable foundation is headed by Bruce Buck, the clubs chairman, and football decisions by the powerful director, Marina Granovskaia, and the technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech, both of whom are already close with Tuchel. I think it will change nothing for me on a daily basis, Tuchel said. This is how I understand it. I am in close contact with Marina and Petr Cech to run the first team of Chelsea football club and to give my input in this and give my very best to win football matches. This will not change with the news from yesterday. There was a poignancy to the occasion as the Wembley crowd stood as one before the game to show support for Ukraine. Football stands together was the message on the big screens before kick-off, there were Ukrainian flags in the crowd and the players of both sides came together to show unity after entering the field of play. The action would begin only after Tuchel and his Liverpool counterpart, Jrgen Klopp, removed blue and yellow flowers from the pitch before watching their sides lock horns in a thrilling contest. Chelsea have lost their past four domestic finals but Tuchel said he had no regrets about losing 11-10 on penalties. The German refused to blame Arrizabalaga after bringing the goalkeeper on for douard Mendy just before the shootout. Arrizabalaga, who had helped Chelsea to win three shootouts this season, was beaten by each of Liverpools takers and lifted the decisive kick over the bar. I feel bad for him, Tuchel said. But no blame. We took the decision because Kepa is training with the players on a daily basis at penalties. They know how good he is. He has more time than Edou to do this. Everyone knows how good he is. This plays a part in how well we shot today. Unfortunately he could not save any. It was a bit harsh on him to miss the one and only penalty. But there is no blame. I take the decisions when I take the decisions. I only take them when I want to take them. I cannot rejudge my decisions when I know the outcome. This is how it is. No blame on him. Blame on me. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it does not work out. This is life as a football coach who does substitutions. Sometimes you bring a player on and he scores. Sometimes he makes a decisive mistake. No regrets. If it is necessary to take the blame, absolutely it is on me. Liverpool had a potential winner for Jol Matip ruled out for a tight offside and Chelsea, who also had two Kai Havertz strikes chalked off, were aggrieved that Romelu Lukaku had a goal ruled out by VAR. We have to accept the quality of the opponent, Tuchel said. This is the most dangerous attacking side in Europe at the moment. Defending like this and playing like this made me very proud today. I had the feeling we created a bit more but maybe that is subjective. This game easily could have gone either way. You need a bit of luck. If you look at the line drawn for the goal of Romelu it is a bit of a weird line [for offside]. But thats it. We cannot have any regrets. Klopp praised Caoimhn Kelleher after starting Liverpools No 2 goalkeeper instead of Alisson Becker. Its been quite a journey from the boy I first saw to the man he is now, Liverpools manager said. Kelleher, 23, was asked what Klopp said to him after Arrizabalagas penalty confirmed Liverpools victory. He just said: Well done for scoring the winning penalty, theres a wall with all the goalkeepers on who have won cups so now you can go on that, the Irishman said.

When Mikel Arteta scanned a well-stocked substitutes bench for potential matchwinners, Calum Chambers face would not have leapt out. So it was a turnup for the books that his defender, who had not kicked a competitive ball in anger for two months and has barely appeared in a matchday squad since, breached Leeds within seconds of coming on and sparked an ultimately straightforward win. Chambers just about beat Illan Meslier with his first touch and Arsenals progression to the quarter-finals was in little doubt thereafter. Chambers had only been deployed because Ben White felt unable to continue after feeling unwell. His intervention was the cue for Arsenal to take complete control of a previously sterile game and their second goal was a reminder of another talent whose career sits at a crossroads. Eddie Nketiahs only previous football this season had come in the third round of this competition, against AFC Wimbledon; he scored in that game and squeezed in another here, although the path to salvaging a long-term future in north London still appears rocky for a player who needs regular starts at 22. Few people doubt his poaching instinct but Artetas post-match comments leaned towards regret that he cannot find a place for Nketiah in his Premier League selection rather than a pledge of future involvement. All the same, an eighth game without defeat spoke well of his fringe mens willingness to come in from the cold and suggested that Arsenals depth, which has come into question, is significantly greater this year. It took several seconds for Chambers first goal since September 2019 to be given, but the reaction spoke volumes. Emile Smith Rowe, who joined White in remaining from the Premier League win over Aston Villa, had been relatively subdued but swung over a corner that Nketiah flicked on. Nicolas Pp nodded back at the far post and an alert Chambers, having run straight into Leeds box, saw his header scooped out by Meslier. Eventually Andre Marriner signalled it had crossed the line and sparked an exuberant celebration in front of the technical area. He totally deserved it, said Arteta of Chambers, who made a beeline for the set-piece coach Nicolas Jover as he raced towards the touchline. It was a great moment because he helped us to win the game. He is someone who deserves the best, for how he is as a person and a professional. There was something else to the acclaim Chambers took from his teammates according to Arteta, who implied such a long spell out of the team had been difficult to take. Nketiahs situation has been similar and his manager was thrilled when, after a woefully undercooked header back from Liam Cooper, the centre-forward nipped in to dink the ball past a stranded Meslier. Even if his subsequent finish was not clean, it did the job; Arteta was keen to stress that is what Nketiah always does. I have no doubt over what he can offer, he said. Whatever you throw at him, he wants more. Im delighted to see the performance he had. I have full belief he will be a top player, and hopefully at Arsenal. For that to happen, Nketiah will want at least a few more morsels of action before the quarter-finals in December. He was central to a bright start from Arsenal, who faded after the 20-minute mark and watched Leeds come closest to scoring during the first half. Jack Harrisons snap shot forced a solid parry from Bernd Leno, another player whose face is decreasing in familiarity, while Tyler Roberts saw a shot deflected wide after Rodrigos clever dummy. In bursts Leeds showed a semblance of the vim they have lost this season under Marcelo Bielsa, who made a relatively paltry four changes, but they lost their way after the interval. The game seemed well poised but they never threatened again and perhaps he overthought things in making three early changes. Clearly the differences between the first and second half came after the goal, Bielsa said, although he admitted he is responsible for the effects of the subs. Leeds more pressing concern is a trip to Norwich on Sunday and, in the long run, a full 90 minutes for the returning Kalvin Phillips may prove the most valuable outcome from an otherwise bland nights work. Arteta will hope White, who had only played because Pablo Mari was suffering from a bug of his own, perks up in time to face Leicester. Martin degaard had also been due to start but picked up a knock. For Arsenal, though, the good news is beginning to override the niggles consistently.

When Mikel Arteta scanned a well-stocked substitutes bench for potential matchwinners, Calum Chambers face would not have leapt out. So it was a turnup for the books that his defender, who had not kicked a competitive ball in anger for two months and has barely appeared in a matchday squad since, breached Leeds within seconds of coming on and sparked an ultimately straightforward win. Chambers just about beat Illan Meslier with his first touch and Arsenals progression to the quarter-finals was in little doubt thereafter. Chambers had only been deployed because Ben White felt unable to continue after feeling unwell. His intervention was the cue for Arsenal to take complete control of a previously sterile game and their second goal was a reminder of another talent whose career sits at a crossroads. Eddie Nketiahs only previous football this season had come in the third round of this competition, against AFC Wimbledon; he scored in that game and squeezed in another here, although the path to salvaging a long-term future in north London still appears rocky for a player who needs regular starts at 22. Few people doubt his poaching instinct but Artetas post-match comments leaned towards regret that he cannot find a place for Nketiah in his Premier League selection rather than a pledge of future involvement. All the same, an eighth game without defeat spoke well of his fringe mens willingness to come in from the cold and suggested that Arsenals depth, which has come into question, is significantly greater this year. It took several seconds for Chambers first goal since September 2019 to be given, but the reaction spoke volumes. Emile Smith Rowe, who joined White in remaining from the Premier League win over Aston Villa, had been relatively subdued but swung over a corner that Nketiah flicked on. Nicolas Pp nodded back at the far post and an alert Chambers, having run straight into Leeds box, saw his header scooped out by Meslier. Eventually Andre Marriner signalled it had crossed the line and sparked an exuberant celebration in front of the technical area. He totally deserved it, said Arteta of Chambers, who made a beeline for the set-piece coach Nicolas Jover as he raced towards the touchline.

For that to happen, Nketiah will want at least a few more morsels of action before the quarter-finals in December. He was central to a bright start from Arsenal, who faded after the 20-minute mark and watched Leeds come closest to scoring during the first half. Jack Harrisons snap shot forced a solid parry from Bernd Leno, another player whose face is decreasing in familiarity, while Tyler Roberts saw a shot deflected wide after Rodrigos clever dummy. In bursts Leeds showed a semblance of the vim they have lost this season under Marcelo Bielsa, who made a relatively paltry four changes, but they lost their way after the interval. The game seemed well poised but they never threatened again and perhaps he overthought things in making three early changes. Clearly the differences between the first and second half came after the goal, Bielsa said, although he admitted he is responsible for the effects of the subs. Leeds more pressing concern is a trip to Norwich on Sunday and, in the long run, a full 90 minutes for the returning Kalvin Phillips may prove the most valuable outcome from an otherwise bland nights work. Arteta will hope White, who had only played because Pablo Mari was suffering from a bug of his own, perks up in time to face Leicester. Martin degaard had also been due to start but picked up a knock. For Arsenal, though, the good news is beginning to override the niggles consistently.

When Mikel Arteta scanned a well-stocked substitutes bench for potential matchwinners, Calum Chambers face would not have leapt out. So it was a turnup for the books that his defender, who had not kicked a competitive ball in anger for two months and has barely appeared in a matchday squad since, breached Leeds within seconds of coming on and sparked an ultimately straightforward win. Chambers just about beat Illan Meslier with his first touch and Arsenals progression to the quarter-finals was in little doubt thereafter. Chambers had only been deployed because Ben White felt unable to continue after feeling unwell. His intervention was the cue for Arsenal to take complete control of a previously sterile game and their second goal was a reminder of another talent whose career sits at a crossroads. Eddie Nketiahs only previous football this season had come in the third round of this competition, against AFC Wimbledon; he scored in that game and squeezed in another here, although the path to salvaging a long-term future in north London still appears rocky for a player who needs regular starts at 22. Few people doubt his poaching instinct but Artetas post-match comments leaned towards regret that he cannot find a place for Nketiah in his Premier League selection rather than a pledge of future involvement. All the same, an eighth game without defeat spoke well of his fringe mens willingness to come in from the cold and suggested that Arsenals depth, which has come into question, is significantly greater this year. It took several seconds for Chambers first goal since September 2019 to be given, but the reaction spoke volumes. Emile Smith Rowe, who joined White in remaining from the Premier League win over Aston Villa, had been relatively subdued but swung over a corner that Nketiah flicked on. Nicolas Pp nodded back at the far post and an alert Chambers, having run straight into Leeds box, saw his header scooped out by Meslier. Eventually Andre Marriner signalled it had crossed the line and sparked an exuberant celebration in front of the technical area. He totally deserved it, said Arteta of Chambers, who made a beeline for the set-piece coach Nicolas Jover as he raced towards the touchline. It was a great moment because he helped us to win the game. He is someone who deserves the best, for how he is as a person and a professional. There was something else to the acclaim Chambers took from his teammates according to Arteta, who implied such a long spell out of the team had been difficult to take. Nketiahs situation has been similar and his manager was thrilled when, after a woefully undercooked header back from Liam Cooper, the centre-forward nipped in to dink the ball past a stranded Meslier. Even if his subsequent finish was not clean, it did the job; Arteta was keen to stress that is what Nketiah always does. I have no doubt over what he can offer, he said.

In bursts Leeds showed a semblance of the vim they have lost this season under Marcelo Bielsa, who made a relatively paltry four changes, but they lost their way after the interval. The game seemed well poised but they never threatened again and perhaps he overthought things in making three early changes. Clearly the differences between the first and second half came after the goal, Bielsa said, although he admitted he is responsible for the effects of the subs. Leeds more pressing concern is a trip to Norwich on Sunday and, in the long run, a full 90 minutes for the returning Kalvin Phillips may prove the most valuable outcome from an otherwise bland nights work. Arteta will hope White, who had only played because Pablo Mari was suffering from a bug of his own, perks up in time to face Leicester. Martin degaard had also been due to start but picked up a knock. For Arsenal, though, the good news is beginning to override the niggles consistently.

When Mikel Arteta scanned a well-stocked substitutes bench for potential matchwinners, Calum Chambers face would not have leapt out. So it was a turnup for the books that his defender, who had not kicked a competitive ball in anger for two months and has barely appeared in a matchday squad since, breached Leeds within seconds of coming on and sparked an ultimately straightforward win. Chambers just about beat Illan Meslier with his first touch and Arsenals progression to the quarter-finals was in little doubt thereafter. Chambers had only been deployed because Ben White felt unable to continue after feeling unwell. His intervention was the cue for Arsenal to take complete control of a previously sterile game and their second goal was a reminder of another talent whose career sits at a crossroads. Eddie Nketiahs only previous football this season had come in the third round of this competition, against AFC Wimbledon; he scored in that game and squeezed in another here, although the path to salvaging a long-term future in north London still appears rocky for a player who needs regular starts at 22. Few people doubt his poaching instinct but Artetas post-match comments leaned towards regret that he cannot find a place for Nketiah in his Premier League selection rather than a pledge of future involvement. All the same, an eighth game without defeat spoke well of his fringe mens willingness to come in from the cold and suggested that Arsenals depth, which has come into question, is significantly greater this year. It took several seconds for Chambers first goal since September 2019 to be given, but the reaction spoke volumes. Emile Smith Rowe, who joined White in remaining from the Premier League win over Aston Villa, had been relatively subdued but swung over a corner that Nketiah flicked on. Nicolas Pp nodded back at the far post and an alert Chambers, having run straight into Leeds box, saw his header scooped out by Meslier. Eventually Andre Marriner signalled it had crossed the line and sparked an exuberant celebration in front of the technical area. He totally deserved it, said Arteta of Chambers, who made a beeline for the set-piece coach Nicolas Jover as he raced towards the touchline. It was a great moment because he helped us to win the game. He is someone who deserves the best, for how he is as a person and a professional. There was something else to the acclaim Chambers took from his teammates according to Arteta, who implied such a long spell out of the team had been difficult to take. Nketiahs situation has been similar and his manager was thrilled when, after a woefully undercooked header back from Liam Cooper, the centre-forward nipped in to dink the ball past a stranded Meslier. Even if his subsequent finish was not clean, it did the job; Arteta was keen to stress that is what Nketiah always does. I have no doubt over what he can offer, he said. Whatever you throw at him, he wants more. Im delighted to see the performance he had. I have full belief he will be a top player, and hopefully at Arsenal. For that to happen, Nketiah will want at least a few more morsels of action before the quarter-finals in December.

Arteta will hope White, who had only played because Pablo Mari was suffering from a bug of his own, perks up in time to face Leicester. Martin degaard had also been due to start but picked up a knock. For Arsenal, though, the good news is beginning to override the niggles consistently.

When Mikel Arteta scanned a well-stocked substitutes bench for potential matchwinners, Calum Chambers face would not have leapt out. So it was a turnup for the books that his defender, who had not kicked a competitive ball in anger for two months and has barely appeared in a matchday squad since, breached Leeds within seconds of coming on and sparked an ultimately straightforward win. Chambers just about beat Illan Meslier with his first touch and Arsenals progression to the quarter-finals was in little doubt thereafter. Chambers had only been deployed because Ben White felt unable to continue after feeling unwell. His intervention was the cue for Arsenal to take complete control of a previously sterile game and their second goal was a reminder of another talent whose career sits at a crossroads. Eddie Nketiahs only previous football this season had come in the third round of this competition, against AFC Wimbledon; he scored in that game and squeezed in another here, although the path to salvaging a long-term future in north London still appears rocky for a player who needs regular starts at 22. Few people doubt his poaching instinct but Artetas post-match comments leaned towards regret that he cannot find a place for Nketiah in his Premier League selection rather than a pledge of future involvement. All the same, an eighth game without defeat spoke well of his fringe mens willingness to come in from the cold and suggested that Arsenals depth, which has come into question, is significantly greater this year. It took several seconds for Chambers first goal since September 2019 to be given, but the reaction spoke volumes. Emile Smith Rowe, who joined White in remaining from the Premier League win over Aston Villa, had been relatively subdued but swung over a corner that Nketiah flicked on. Nicolas Pp nodded back at the far post and an alert Chambers, having run straight into Leeds box, saw his header scooped out by Meslier. Eventually Andre Marriner signalled it had crossed the line and sparked an exuberant celebration in front of the technical area. He totally deserved it, said Arteta of Chambers, who made a beeline for the set-piece coach Nicolas Jover as he raced towards the touchline. It was a great moment because he helped us to win the game. He is someone who deserves the best, for how he is as a person and a professional. There was something else to the acclaim Chambers took from his teammates according to Arteta, who implied such a long spell out of the team had been difficult to take. Nketiahs situation has been similar and his manager was thrilled when, after a woefully undercooked header back from Liam Cooper, the centre-forward nipped in to dink the ball past a stranded Meslier. Even if his subsequent finish was not clean, it did the job; Arteta was keen to stress that is what Nketiah always does. I have no doubt over what he can offer, he said. Whatever you throw at him, he wants more. Im delighted to see the performance he had. I have full belief he will be a top player, and hopefully at Arsenal. For that to happen, Nketiah will want at least a few more morsels of action before the quarter-finals in December. He was central to a bright start from Arsenal, who faded after the 20-minute mark and watched Leeds come closest to scoring during the first half. Jack Harrisons snap shot forced a solid parry from Bernd Leno, another player whose face is decreasing in familiarity, while Tyler Roberts saw a shot deflected wide after Rodrigos clever dummy. In bursts Leeds showed a semblance of the vim they have lost this season under Marcelo Bielsa, who made a relatively paltry four changes, but they lost their way after the interval. The game seemed well poised but they never threatened again and perhaps he overthought things in making three early changes. Clearly the differences between the first and second half came after the goal, Bielsa said, although he admitted he is responsible for the effects of the subs.
