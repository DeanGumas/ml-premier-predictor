Starting as a final project for a masters course in machine learning at USC, ML Premier Predictor is an ongoing personal project working to create the best models for predicting player performance in the English Premier League.

Originally forked from https://github.com/danielfrees/mlpremier, this project works to improve upon their results by using a variety of CNN, RNN and transformer based models written in PyTorch.

Python notebooks are available to use to locally train and evaluate each of the implemented machine learning models (CNN, deep CNN, 2D-CNN, RNN + transformer) and are located within the premier_league_models directory.

Easier executable and eventual web implementation are under development!
