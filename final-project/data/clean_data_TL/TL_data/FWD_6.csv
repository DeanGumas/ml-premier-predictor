Benfica salvaged pride at Anfield whereas Liverpool preserved dreams of a seventh European crown and unprecedented quadruple. Jrgen Klopp will consider it a decent exchange. There was humility to Liverpools exit after the final whistle in comparison with jubilant scenes among Benfica fans who serenaded the classy Darwin Nez and co after their late, VAR-shaped recovery. Perhaps the lapses in concentration when comfortably ahead were playing on Liverpool minds, or the knowledge they must go again in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Saturday, but they had cause for celebration regardless. A Champions League semi-final against Villarreal awaits Liverpool after a fluctuating contest when a header from Ibrahima Konat and a brace from Roberto Firmino extended the comfort of their 3-1 first leg lead. Benfica fought back from 3-1 down on the night courtesy of two late goals that were disallowed for offside before being awarded by VAR. Nez had two other goals ruled out for offside. Their efforts were in vain. Liverpool march on to a 12th European Cup/Champions League semi-final, equalling Manchester Uniteds record for an English club, and remain confidently on course for a third Champions League final in five seasons under Klopp. On the two previous occasions Liverpool defeated Benfica in the quarter-finals  1978 and 1984  they went on to lift the trophy. Klopp is more concerned by practicalities than omens and made seven changes from the team that started Sundays draw at City on the basis the quarter-final second leg demanded the freshest legs. His schedule necessitates rotation but there was no doubt the team sheet will have raised Benficas hopes before kick-off. They were only ever slender hopes. This was Liverpools 200th European game at Anfield. Only seven of the previous 199 had ended in a loss of two goals or more. There was a minutes silence before the game in memory of the 97 Liverpool fans unlawfully killed at Hillsborough 33 years ago this Friday. It would be nice to report that it was impeccably observed but a few moronic individuals in the Benfica section, ignoring the shushes that came from the majority around them, decided otherwise. With Mohamed Salah rested on the bench for the first time in a Champions League game this season Klopp tasked Luis Daz with troubling Benfica from the right. The former Porto winger again impressed against his old rivals, with his pace, touch and direct movement a constant thorn in the visitors defence. A threaded ball from Jordan Henderson enabled Daz to exchanges passes with Firmino before darting to the byline and crossing dangerously into the Benfica goalmouth. Goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos, injured moments earlier when saving bravely at the feet of Diogo Jota, fumbled under pressure from James Milner but recovered in time to claw the loose ball away from Firmino. Liverpool remained on the attack and opened the scoring with a repeat of their first goal at Estdio da Luz. Kostas Tsimikas, starting in place of Andy Robertson, swung a corner into the Benfica area where Konat rose above a statuesque Jan Vertonghen and Nicols Otamendi to head inside Vlachodimos left hand corner. Konat had opened his Liverpool account in similar style eight days ago. Lessons had not been learned in the Benfica defence. There were warning signs for Liverpool, however. Everton curled a shot just wide of Alissons top corner in the opening minutes and Nez thought he had cancelled out Konats header with an exquisite chip over the Liverpool goalkeeper. The dangerous centre-forward was offside when racing through on to Evertons pass, however. Benfica were growing more confident on the ball, encouraged by some loose Liverpool play, and levelled for the first time on the night when Gonalo Ramos beat Alisson with a convincing finish. Liverpool looked to VAR to save them with an offside call against Ramos but Milner, challenging Diogo Gonalves in midfield, had inadvertently played the goalscorer through. Liverpool should have restored their lead before the interval but Firmino delayed a pass to an unmarked Daz and gave Alejandro Grimaldo time to sweep clear. The Colombia international was far from impressed. The Brazilian made amends with two goals in quick succession early in the second half. His first was a shambles from a Portuguese perspective. Naby Keta instigated the move with a piercing pass towards Daz. Vlachodimos arrived first but the goalkeeper, impressive in the first leg, fumbled once again and forced Vertonghen into a desperate clearance that he sliced to Jota. The Liverpool striker scuffed his shot across goal but Firmino was on hand to convert into an empty net. Firminos second was a controlled volley at the back post from a Tsimikas free-kick that sailed over the Benfica defence. Liverpool were coasting into the last four and switched off as a result. Benfica substitute Roman Yaremchuk was flagged offside after receiving Julian Weigls pass, rounding Alisson and rolling into an unguarded net. VAR spotted he had been played onside by Joe Gomez and Benfica had a lifeline in the game, if not the tie. A third followed in similar fashion. Nezs cool finish after collecting a long ball out of defence was disallowed and then awarded after a lengthy VAR review. The Uruguay forward struck again in the 95th minute but this time he was offside. Liverpools quest continues.

Vlachodimos arrived first but the goalkeeper, impressive in the first leg, fumbled once again and forced Vertonghen into a desperate clearance that he sliced to Jota. The Liverpool striker scuffed his shot across goal but Firmino was on hand to convert into an empty net. Firminos second was a controlled volley at the back post from a Tsimikas free-kick that sailed over the Benfica defence. Liverpool were coasting into the last four and switched off as a result. Benfica substitute Roman Yaremchuk was flagged offside after receiving Julian Weigls pass, rounding Alisson and rolling into an unguarded net. VAR spotted he had been played onside by Joe Gomez and Benfica had a lifeline in the game, if not the tie. A third followed in similar fashion. Nezs cool finish after collecting a long ball out of defence was disallowed and then awarded after a lengthy VAR review. The Uruguay forward struck again in the 95th minute but this time he was offside. Liverpools quest continues.

Benfica salvaged pride at Anfield whereas Liverpool preserved dreams of a seventh European crown and unprecedented quadruple. Jrgen Klopp will consider it a decent exchange. There was humility to Liverpools exit after the final whistle in comparison with jubilant scenes among Benfica fans who serenaded the classy Darwin Nez and co after their late, VAR-shaped recovery. Perhaps the lapses in concentration when comfortably ahead were playing on Liverpool minds, or the knowledge they must go again in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Saturday, but they had cause for celebration regardless. A Champions League semi-final against Villarreal awaits Liverpool after a fluctuating contest when a header from Ibrahima Konat and a brace from Roberto Firmino extended the comfort of their 3-1 first leg lead. Benfica fought back from 3-1 down on the night courtesy of two late goals that were disallowed for offside before being awarded by VAR. Nez had two other goals ruled out for offside. Their efforts were in vain. Liverpool march on to a 12th European Cup/Champions League semi-final, equalling Manchester Uniteds record for an English club, and remain confidently on course for a third Champions League final in five seasons under Klopp. On the two previous occasions Liverpool defeated Benfica in the quarter-finals  1978 and 1984  they went on to lift the trophy. Klopp is more concerned by practicalities than omens and made seven changes from the team that started Sundays draw at City on the basis the quarter-final second leg demanded the freshest legs. His schedule necessitates rotation but there was no doubt the team sheet will have raised Benficas hopes before kick-off. They were only ever slender hopes. This was Liverpools 200th European game at Anfield. Only seven of the previous 199 had ended in a loss of two goals or more. There was a minutes silence before the game in memory of the 97 Liverpool fans unlawfully killed at Hillsborough 33 years ago this Friday. It would be nice to report that it was impeccably observed but a few moronic individuals in the Benfica section, ignoring the shushes that came from the majority around them, decided otherwise. With Mohamed Salah rested on the bench for the first time in a Champions League game this season Klopp tasked Luis Daz with troubling Benfica from the right. The former Porto winger again impressed against his old rivals, with his pace, touch and direct movement a constant thorn in the visitors defence. A threaded ball from Jordan Henderson enabled Daz to exchanges passes with Firmino before darting to the byline and crossing dangerously into the Benfica goalmouth. Goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos, injured moments earlier when saving bravely at the feet of Diogo Jota, fumbled under pressure from James Milner but recovered in time to claw the loose ball away from Firmino. Liverpool remained on the attack and opened the scoring with a repeat of their first goal at Estdio da Luz. Kostas Tsimikas, starting in place of Andy Robertson, swung a corner into the Benfica area where Konat rose above a statuesque Jan Vertonghen and Nicols Otamendi to head inside Vlachodimos left hand corner. Konat had opened his Liverpool account in similar style eight days ago. Lessons had not been learned in the Benfica defence. There were warning signs for Liverpool, however. Everton curled a shot just wide of Alissons top corner in the opening minutes and Nez thought he had cancelled out Konats header with an exquisite chip over the Liverpool goalkeeper. The dangerous centre-forward was offside when racing through on to Evertons pass, however. Benfica were growing more confident on the ball, encouraged by some loose Liverpool play, and levelled for the first time on the night when Gonalo Ramos beat Alisson with a convincing finish. Liverpool looked to VAR to save them with an offside call against Ramos but Milner, challenging Diogo Gonalves in midfield, had inadvertently played the goalscorer through. Liverpool should have restored their lead before the interval but Firmino delayed a pass to an unmarked Daz and gave Alejandro Grimaldo time to sweep clear.

Rebekah Vardy has said she deeply regrets making unflattering personal remarks about Peter Andre in a newspaper interview, as the multimillion pound Wagatha Christie libel trial against Coleen Rooney got under way at the high court. The trial between the two footballers wives is taking place in a wood-panelled Victorian-era courtroom in central London that has heard many important cases over the years  but this could be the first where physiological matters were discussed at such length. With the leaking of private information at the heart of the much-anticipated case, David Sherborne, acting for Coleen Rooney, asked Vardy whether she was the sort of person who leaked stories to the media. After Vardy said she was not, the lawyer began reading out excerpts from a 2004 interview Vardy once gave to the News of the World about a one-night stand she supposedly had with singer and entertainer Peter Andre. Sherborne quoted Vardys words from the interview: Peters hung like a small chipolata  the smallest trouser equipment Ive ever seen. After Vardy confirmed she did not seek Andres permission to reveal this personal detail in a national newspaper, the barrister asked: Did you feel particularly strongly about the size of his manhood that it should be made public? Vardy insisted she deeply regrets the incident and was coerced into giving the interview to the tabloid against her will by her ex-husband, an allegation the ex-husband has previously denied. The week-long trial pits the two wives of former England footballers  known as Wags  against each other. In 2019, Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: Its Rebekah Vardys account. Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing that the accusation was false. After an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun  or to convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. Rooney and her husband, Wayne Rooney, looked on intently as Vardy gave evidence on Tuesday afternoon. Rooneys lawyers accepted they do not have a smoking gun that shows Vardy  the wife of the Leicester City player Jamie Vardy  actively leaking stories from Rooneys private Instagram account to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court this did not matter due to the weight of circumstantial evidence against Vardy. In essence this is a detective story, he said. Like any good detective story, you never find the person responsible standing over the body with the smoking gun in hand  Theres inference, circumstance, probability and likelihood and ultimately they all add up  so the finger will point to the right suspect or suspects. In written submissions, Vardys barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned anyone else to do so on her behalf. However, the court did hear Vardy has recently realised her former agent and close friend, Caroline Watt, may have briefed stories to the tabloid without her knowledge. Tomlinson said the candid WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that from time to time they did discuss leaking information to the press. But only one story  a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater  was mentioned. As a result, Rooney simply cant establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible for the leaks, Tomlinson told the court. He said that although the Wagatha Christie case was being treated as a form of entertainment by much of the media, his client had been subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature as a result of Rooneys allegedly false accusation. Rooneys legal team argue that Vardy and Watt made a concerted effort to destroy evidence, with a litany of technological accidents affecting the retrieval of WhatsApp messages. In one incident, Sheborne highlighted how a poor unfortunate phone belonging to Watt was accidentally dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland within days of a legal request to search it. In written submissions, Rooneys lawyers said these were not a series of unfortunate incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a deliberate and calculated campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence  and prevent a fair trial. Sherborne said it did not make a difference if it was Vardys agent who leaked stories to the Sun on behalf of the footballers wife: Its like hiring a hitman or woman  just because youre not the person who gets their hands dirty doesnt mean youre not equally responsible. He concluded his opening remarks by suggesting the entire case against his client  and the millions of pounds spend on years of legal proceedings  was a pointless endeavour: This whole court might just think: Why on earth are we here? The case continues.

Michelle Gayle was 10 months into her role as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last March  and in such full swing that she was in total denial of the pandemic  when the West End closed its doors. Sitting in a chintzy backroom of the Palace theatre now, she talks in athletic terms about 12-hour rehearsal days and re-building her stamina. The whole cast is ecstatic to be back, she says, but they are also whispering about how tired they feel. Exhaustion aside, she speaks of her debt to Noma Dumezweni, whose casting in 2016 sparked online outrage from some at the prospect of a Black Hermione. JK Rowling piled in to the furore to defend the casting and call out the complaints as racist. Dumezweni won an Olivier award for the part. I owe her a lot of gratitude  Im standing on her shoulders, says Gayle. She got through that [time] with incredible grace and proved she was there on merit because shes a bloody good actress but she had to take a big hit online to do that. When someone of the quality of Noma steps up, no ones got anything more to say and then the conversations dead. Its a shame that you have to be brilliant to end that conversation, but there are enough brilliant black actors out there. We are living in a new world where diversity is on everyones agenda but does Gayle feel the industry has corrected itself significantly since last summers black square pledges to do better from theatres and TV production companies? I think people are starting to be bolder, and I think they realise that true allyship is about being bolder. As someone who began life on TV at a tender age  first in Grange Hill as a teenager in 1988 and then EastEnders  she feels that the theatre industry is ahead in the game. TV is playing catch-up and it needs to play catch-up. I think theres been reflection, but weve yet to see that reflected on screen. I believe that they will be held to account and we will not take the foot off the gas as actors of colour, because were discussing things that we shouldnt even have needed to discuss. The TV companies and production companies that posted black squares last summer will be held to account, 100%. Gayle is an actor, Brit-nominated singer, novelist, script-writer, reality TV star and  perhaps most quirkily  was a contender in the Eurovision song contest. Alongside her current West End gig, she is writing an episode of Skys A Discovery of Witches and developing a show for a TV channel. I wonder what she considers herself to be first and foremost? Ive never looked at myself in that way. Ive wanted to act, sing, write. Ive done it from a very young age so for me it would feel strange to choose one and cut another off. Still, it takes nerve to leave a prime-time soap opera, as Gayle did when she exited EastEnders, to embark on a singing career. I knew that I was taking a risk because my record company told me not to do it. They said absolutely dont leave EastEnders because this might not work out. I never regretted it  it was the right thing to do. Her character in the soap, Hattie Tavernier, was part of Albert Squares first Black British family, a watershed moment for representation in mainstream TV. Looking back, does she think the Taverniers were quite basic in their characterisation  a series of types and maybe even cliches? Of course it was basic because I grew up in London, in Harlesden, where most people are black, Asian or Irish. But these were firsts and there was a lot of fear around how we would be received around the country beyond London, in areas that arent so diverse. In 2011, she published her first novel, Pride and Premiership, partly inspired by her experience of being married to professional footballer, Mark Bright, for a decade until 2008. The idea came to her at the Edinburgh TV festival, where a psychologist said that 66% of schoolgirls that year had said they wanted to be a Wag. I was shocked at that. I thought if thats the case, let me give them an insight. Does she think that girls are growing up with bigger dreams and passions today or have they simply graduated to the dream of becoming influencers and Love Island contestants? Theres clearly a massive Kim Kardashian following of getting your hair done, getting your lips done, but I still feel that within that you can still be feminist and strong. Its also just as important to talk about feminism to boys, she adds, speaking of her two sons, aged nine and 21. I make it very clear to my boys how to treat a woman, what a woman stands for, how they should be viewed. I have discussions with them around feminist issues. My nine-year-old hears something and will say oh thats so sexist to me, which I love. What kind of prejudice has she encountered in her career trajectory and has she ever felt boxed in? A lot of people think if youre multi-disciplinary, you cant be serious enough about one thing. Americans dont have that prejudice so much, so someone like J-Lo can sell perfume, act, sing and be in a film. Thats much more acceptable from a man in Britain  so Kenneth Branagh is allowed to write and act but if youre female theres doubt. Someone like Michaela Coel has been able to do it, too  shes gone from acting to writing, from comedy to drama. Gayles school recognised her talent for singing and dancing and at around eight she was sent to the Barbara Speake Stage School in Acton, west London, which had a starry young cohort at the time including Naomi Campbell, Amma Asante, and Kwame Kwei-Armah. Was there a lot of competitive jostling and rivalry? It was tough, she says, but her now famous contemporaries were also each others biggest allies. Naomi is my best friend to this day  and Kwame was the one I looked up to. He was older than us and just so talented. Her Jamaica-born father, a mechanical engineer, and Grenada-born mother, a social worker, allowed Gayle, the eldest of their five children, to pursue her passions. By the time she was 13, she was paying her own school fees with acting jobs. Her mother was worried all the same. She was very academic led and she also said Do I see people like you on TV? No. So how is this going to work out? So I had to get good exam results  that was a condition of me staying at stage school. While Gayle puts her multi-disciplinary trajectory down to many passions, it was also a case of making a virtue out of necessity. While at stage school, she was regularly left alone in the classroom, while her counterparts were asked to audition for shows. (Theatre and TV production companies looking for cast members would, at that time, specify race.) They would say, All the white girls aged between eight and 10 go down and audition. I was the only black person in my class so Id be left in the classroom. I knew from a very young age that Id always have fewer auditions and this lack of opportunity was physicalised  no one needed to tell me. I knew Id be sitting in the classroom a lot if I only waited for acting jobs. How did she cope with the other pressures of stage school at such a young age? It was hard, and brilliant in equal measure. Its hard because you do get judged on the stage and your headteacher does tell you That wasnt good enough. Did it crush some of her classmates? Yeah, and I realised that because we had a school reunion a few years ago and some people were in therapy because of it. But it made me really tough. If someone says no, I dont accept it and thats been built in me from school. For me, a no is just a delay  its a not yet. I truly believe thats how Ive been able to sustain earning money in this industry  not because Im more talented than the other people in my class. Its my bounce-backability. That, she says, along with taking risks and always being led by her passions. Theres a Jamaican saying Nothing good comes easy, she says, as she takes a slug from her water bottle and leaves to begin her 12-hour day. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is at the Palace theatre, London from 14 October.

Michelle Gayle was 10 months into her role as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last March  and in such full swing that she was in total denial of the pandemic  when the West End closed its doors. Sitting in a chintzy backroom of the Palace theatre now, she talks in athletic terms about 12-hour rehearsal days and re-building her stamina. The whole cast is ecstatic to be back, she says, but they are also whispering about how tired they feel. Exhaustion aside, she speaks of her debt to Noma Dumezweni, whose casting in 2016 sparked online outrage from some at the prospect of a Black Hermione. JK Rowling piled in to the furore to defend the casting and call out the complaints as racist. Dumezweni won an Olivier award for the part. I owe her a lot of gratitude  Im standing on her shoulders, says Gayle. She got through that [time] with incredible grace and proved she was there on merit because shes a bloody good actress but she had to take a big hit online to do that. When someone of the quality of Noma steps up, no ones got anything more to say and then the conversations dead. Its a shame that you have to be brilliant to end that conversation, but there are enough brilliant black actors out there. We are living in a new world where diversity is on everyones agenda but does Gayle feel the industry has corrected itself significantly since last summers black square pledges to do better from theatres and TV production companies? I think people are starting to be bolder, and I think they realise that true allyship is about being bolder. As someone who began life on TV at a tender age  first in Grange Hill as a teenager in 1988 and then EastEnders  she feels that the theatre industry is ahead in the game. TV is playing catch-up and it needs to play catch-up. I think theres been reflection, but weve yet to see that reflected on screen.

Gayle is an actor, Brit-nominated singer, novelist, script-writer, reality TV star and  perhaps most quirkily  was a contender in the Eurovision song contest. Alongside her current West End gig, she is writing an episode of Skys A Discovery of Witches and developing a show for a TV channel. I wonder what she considers herself to be first and foremost? Ive never looked at myself in that way. Ive wanted to act, sing, write. Ive done it from a very young age so for me it would feel strange to choose one and cut another off. Still, it takes nerve to leave a prime-time soap opera, as Gayle did when she exited EastEnders, to embark on a singing career. I knew that I was taking a risk because my record company told me not to do it. They said absolutely dont leave EastEnders because this might not work out. I never regretted it  it was the right thing to do. Her character in the soap, Hattie Tavernier, was part of Albert Squares first Black British family, a watershed moment for representation in mainstream TV. Looking back, does she think the Taverniers were quite basic in their characterisation  a series of types and maybe even cliches? Of course it was basic because I grew up in London, in Harlesden, where most people are black, Asian or Irish. But these were firsts and there was a lot of fear around how we would be received around the country beyond London, in areas that arent so diverse. In 2011, she published her first novel, Pride and Premiership, partly inspired by her experience of being married to professional footballer, Mark Bright, for a decade until 2008. The idea came to her at the Edinburgh TV festival, where a psychologist said that 66% of schoolgirls that year had said they wanted to be a Wag. I was shocked at that. I thought if thats the case, let me give them an insight. Does she think that girls are growing up with bigger dreams and passions today or have they simply graduated to the dream of becoming influencers and Love Island contestants? Theres clearly a massive Kim Kardashian following of getting your hair done, getting your lips done, but I still feel that within that you can still be feminist and strong. Its also just as important to talk about feminism to boys, she adds, speaking of her two sons, aged nine and 21. I make it very clear to my boys how to treat a woman, what a woman stands for, how they should be viewed. I have discussions with them around feminist issues. My nine-year-old hears something and will say oh thats so sexist to me, which I love. What kind of prejudice has she encountered in her career trajectory and has she ever felt boxed in? A lot of people think if youre multi-disciplinary, you cant be serious enough about one thing. Americans dont have that prejudice so much, so someone like J-Lo can sell perfume, act, sing and be in a film. Thats much more acceptable from a man in Britain  so Kenneth Branagh is allowed to write and act but if youre female theres doubt. Someone like Michaela Coel has been able to do it, too  shes gone from acting to writing, from comedy to drama. Gayles school recognised her talent for singing and dancing and at around eight she was sent to the Barbara Speake Stage School in Acton, west London, which had a starry young cohort at the time including Naomi Campbell, Amma Asante, and Kwame Kwei-Armah. Was there a lot of competitive jostling and rivalry? It was tough, she says, but her now famous contemporaries were also each others biggest allies. Naomi is my best friend to this day  and Kwame was the one I looked up to. He was older than us and just so talented. Her Jamaica-born father, a mechanical engineer, and Grenada-born mother, a social worker, allowed Gayle, the eldest of their five children, to pursue her passions. By the time she was 13, she was paying her own school fees with acting jobs. Her mother was worried all the same. She was very academic led and she also said Do I see people like you on TV? No. So how is this going to work out? So I had to get good exam results  that was a condition of me staying at stage school. While Gayle puts her multi-disciplinary trajectory down to many passions, it was also a case of making a virtue out of necessity. While at stage school, she was regularly left alone in the classroom, while her counterparts were asked to audition for shows. (Theatre and TV production companies looking for cast members would, at that time, specify race.) They would say, All the white girls aged between eight and 10 go down and audition. I was the only black person in my class so Id be left in the classroom. I knew from a very young age that Id always have fewer auditions and this lack of opportunity was physicalised  no one needed to tell me. I knew Id be sitting in the classroom a lot if I only waited for acting jobs. How did she cope with the other pressures of stage school at such a young age? It was hard, and brilliant in equal measure. Its hard because you do get judged on the stage and your headteacher does tell you That wasnt good enough. Did it crush some of her classmates? Yeah, and I realised that because we had a school reunion a few years ago and some people were in therapy because of it. But it made me really tough. If someone says no, I dont accept it and thats been built in me from school. For me, a no is just a delay  its a not yet. I truly believe thats how Ive been able to sustain earning money in this industry  not because Im more talented than the other people in my class. Its my bounce-backability. That, she says, along with taking risks and always being led by her passions. Theres a Jamaican saying Nothing good comes easy, she says, as she takes a slug from her water bottle and leaves to begin her 12-hour day. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is at the Palace theatre, London from 14 October.

Michelle Gayle was 10 months into her role as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last March  and in such full swing that she was in total denial of the pandemic  when the West End closed its doors. Sitting in a chintzy backroom of the Palace theatre now, she talks in athletic terms about 12-hour rehearsal days and re-building her stamina. The whole cast is ecstatic to be back, she says, but they are also whispering about how tired they feel. Exhaustion aside, she speaks of her debt to Noma Dumezweni, whose casting in 2016 sparked online outrage from some at the prospect of a Black Hermione. JK Rowling piled in to the furore to defend the casting and call out the complaints as racist. Dumezweni won an Olivier award for the part. I owe her a lot of gratitude  Im standing on her shoulders, says Gayle. She got through that [time] with incredible grace and proved she was there on merit because shes a bloody good actress but she had to take a big hit online to do that. When someone of the quality of Noma steps up, no ones got anything more to say and then the conversations dead. Its a shame that you have to be brilliant to end that conversation, but there are enough brilliant black actors out there. We are living in a new world where diversity is on everyones agenda but does Gayle feel the industry has corrected itself significantly since last summers black square pledges to do better from theatres and TV production companies? I think people are starting to be bolder, and I think they realise that true allyship is about being bolder. As someone who began life on TV at a tender age  first in Grange Hill as a teenager in 1988 and then EastEnders  she feels that the theatre industry is ahead in the game. TV is playing catch-up and it needs to play catch-up. I think theres been reflection, but weve yet to see that reflected on screen.

Gayle is an actor, Brit-nominated singer, novelist, script-writer, reality TV star and  perhaps most quirkily  was a contender in the Eurovision song contest. Alongside her current West End gig, she is writing an episode of Skys A Discovery of Witches and developing a show for a TV channel. I wonder what she considers herself to be first and foremost? Ive never looked at myself in that way. Ive wanted to act, sing, write. Ive done it from a very young age so for me it would feel strange to choose one and cut another off. Still, it takes nerve to leave a prime-time soap opera, as Gayle did when she exited EastEnders, to embark on a singing career. I knew that I was taking a risk because my record company told me not to do it. They said absolutely dont leave EastEnders because this might not work out. I never regretted it  it was the right thing to do. Her character in the soap, Hattie Tavernier, was part of Albert Squares first Black British family, a watershed moment for representation in mainstream TV. Looking back, does she think the Taverniers were quite basic in their characterisation  a series of types and maybe even cliches? Of course it was basic because I grew up in London, in Harlesden, where most people are black, Asian or Irish. But these were firsts and there was a lot of fear around how we would be received around the country beyond London, in areas that arent so diverse. In 2011, she published her first novel, Pride and Premiership, partly inspired by her experience of being married to professional footballer, Mark Bright, for a decade until 2008. The idea came to her at the Edinburgh TV festival, where a psychologist said that 66% of schoolgirls that year had said they wanted to be a Wag. I was shocked at that. I thought if thats the case, let me give them an insight. Does she think that girls are growing up with bigger dreams and passions today or have they simply graduated to the dream of becoming influencers and Love Island contestants? Theres clearly a massive Kim Kardashian following of getting your hair done, getting your lips done, but I still feel that within that you can still be feminist and strong. Its also just as important to talk about feminism to boys, she adds, speaking of her two sons, aged nine and 21. I make it very clear to my boys how to treat a woman, what a woman stands for, how they should be viewed. I have discussions with them around feminist issues. My nine-year-old hears something and will say oh thats so sexist to me, which I love. What kind of prejudice has she encountered in her career trajectory and has she ever felt boxed in? A lot of people think if youre multi-disciplinary, you cant be serious enough about one thing. Americans dont have that prejudice so much, so someone like J-Lo can sell perfume, act, sing and be in a film. Thats much more acceptable from a man in Britain  so Kenneth Branagh is allowed to write and act but if youre female theres doubt. Someone like Michaela Coel has been able to do it, too  shes gone from acting to writing, from comedy to drama. Gayles school recognised her talent for singing and dancing and at around eight she was sent to the Barbara Speake Stage School in Acton, west London, which had a starry young cohort at the time including Naomi Campbell, Amma Asante, and Kwame Kwei-Armah. Was there a lot of competitive jostling and rivalry? It was tough, she says, but her now famous contemporaries were also each others biggest allies. Naomi is my best friend to this day  and Kwame was the one I looked up to. He was older than us and just so talented. Her Jamaica-born father, a mechanical engineer, and Grenada-born mother, a social worker, allowed Gayle, the eldest of their five children, to pursue her passions. By the time she was 13, she was paying her own school fees with acting jobs. Her mother was worried all the same. She was very academic led and she also said Do I see people like you on TV? No. So how is this going to work out? So I had to get good exam results  that was a condition of me staying at stage school. While Gayle puts her multi-disciplinary trajectory down to many passions, it was also a case of making a virtue out of necessity. While at stage school, she was regularly left alone in the classroom, while her counterparts were asked to audition for shows. (Theatre and TV production companies looking for cast members would, at that time, specify race.) They would say, All the white girls aged between eight and 10 go down and audition. I was the only black person in my class so Id be left in the classroom. I knew from a very young age that Id always have fewer auditions and this lack of opportunity was physicalised  no one needed to tell me. I knew Id be sitting in the classroom a lot if I only waited for acting jobs. How did she cope with the other pressures of stage school at such a young age? It was hard, and brilliant in equal measure. Its hard because you do get judged on the stage and your headteacher does tell you That wasnt good enough. Did it crush some of her classmates? Yeah, and I realised that because we had a school reunion a few years ago and some people were in therapy because of it. But it made me really tough. If someone says no, I dont accept it and thats been built in me from school. For me, a no is just a delay  its a not yet. I truly believe thats how Ive been able to sustain earning money in this industry  not because Im more talented than the other people in my class. Its my bounce-backability. That, she says, along with taking risks and always being led by her passions. Theres a Jamaican saying Nothing good comes easy, she says, as she takes a slug from her water bottle and leaves to begin her 12-hour day. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is at the Palace theatre, London from 14 October.

Michelle Gayle was 10 months into her role as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last March  and in such full swing that she was in total denial of the pandemic  when the West End closed its doors. Sitting in a chintzy backroom of the Palace theatre now, she talks in athletic terms about 12-hour rehearsal days and re-building her stamina. The whole cast is ecstatic to be back, she says, but they are also whispering about how tired they feel. Exhaustion aside, she speaks of her debt to Noma Dumezweni, whose casting in 2016 sparked online outrage from some at the prospect of a Black Hermione. JK Rowling piled in to the furore to defend the casting and call out the complaints as racist. Dumezweni won an Olivier award for the part. I owe her a lot of gratitude  Im standing on her shoulders, says Gayle. She got through that [time] with incredible grace and proved she was there on merit because shes a bloody good actress but she had to take a big hit online to do that. When someone of the quality of Noma steps up, no ones got anything more to say and then the conversations dead. Its a shame that you have to be brilliant to end that conversation, but there are enough brilliant black actors out there. We are living in a new world where diversity is on everyones agenda but does Gayle feel the industry has corrected itself significantly since last summers black square pledges to do better from theatres and TV production companies? I think people are starting to be bolder, and I think they realise that true allyship is about being bolder. As someone who began life on TV at a tender age  first in Grange Hill as a teenager in 1988 and then EastEnders  she feels that the theatre industry is ahead in the game. TV is playing catch-up and it needs to play catch-up. I think theres been reflection, but weve yet to see that reflected on screen.

Gayle is an actor, Brit-nominated singer, novelist, script-writer, reality TV star and  perhaps most quirkily  was a contender in the Eurovision song contest. Alongside her current West End gig, she is writing an episode of Skys A Discovery of Witches and developing a show for a TV channel. I wonder what she considers herself to be first and foremost? Ive never looked at myself in that way. Ive wanted to act, sing, write. Ive done it from a very young age so for me it would feel strange to choose one and cut another off. Still, it takes nerve to leave a prime-time soap opera, as Gayle did when she exited EastEnders, to embark on a singing career. I knew that I was taking a risk because my record company told me not to do it. They said absolutely dont leave EastEnders because this might not work out. I never regretted it  it was the right thing to do. Her character in the soap, Hattie Tavernier, was part of Albert Squares first Black British family, a watershed moment for representation in mainstream TV. Looking back, does she think the Taverniers were quite basic in their characterisation  a series of types and maybe even cliches? Of course it was basic because I grew up in London, in Harlesden, where most people are black, Asian or Irish. But these were firsts and there was a lot of fear around how we would be received around the country beyond London, in areas that arent so diverse. In 2011, she published her first novel, Pride and Premiership, partly inspired by her experience of being married to professional footballer, Mark Bright, for a decade until 2008. The idea came to her at the Edinburgh TV festival, where a psychologist said that 66% of schoolgirls that year had said they wanted to be a Wag. I was shocked at that. I thought if thats the case, let me give them an insight. Does she think that girls are growing up with bigger dreams and passions today or have they simply graduated to the dream of becoming influencers and Love Island contestants? Theres clearly a massive Kim Kardashian following of getting your hair done, getting your lips done, but I still feel that within that you can still be feminist and strong. Its also just as important to talk about feminism to boys, she adds, speaking of her two sons, aged nine and 21. I make it very clear to my boys how to treat a woman, what a woman stands for, how they should be viewed. I have discussions with them around feminist issues. My nine-year-old hears something and will say oh thats so sexist to me, which I love. What kind of prejudice has she encountered in her career trajectory and has she ever felt boxed in? A lot of people think if youre multi-disciplinary, you cant be serious enough about one thing. Americans dont have that prejudice so much, so someone like J-Lo can sell perfume, act, sing and be in a film. Thats much more acceptable from a man in Britain  so Kenneth Branagh is allowed to write and act but if youre female theres doubt. Someone like Michaela Coel has been able to do it, too  shes gone from acting to writing, from comedy to drama. Gayles school recognised her talent for singing and dancing and at around eight she was sent to the Barbara Speake Stage School in Acton, west London, which had a starry young cohort at the time including Naomi Campbell, Amma Asante, and Kwame Kwei-Armah. Was there a lot of competitive jostling and rivalry? It was tough, she says, but her now famous contemporaries were also each others biggest allies. Naomi is my best friend to this day  and Kwame was the one I looked up to. He was older than us and just so talented. Her Jamaica-born father, a mechanical engineer, and Grenada-born mother, a social worker, allowed Gayle, the eldest of their five children, to pursue her passions. By the time she was 13, she was paying her own school fees with acting jobs. Her mother was worried all the same. She was very academic led and she also said Do I see people like you on TV? No. So how is this going to work out? So I had to get good exam results  that was a condition of me staying at stage school. While Gayle puts her multi-disciplinary trajectory down to many passions, it was also a case of making a virtue out of necessity. While at stage school, she was regularly left alone in the classroom, while her counterparts were asked to audition for shows. (Theatre and TV production companies looking for cast members would, at that time, specify race.) They would say, All the white girls aged between eight and 10 go down and audition. I was the only black person in my class so Id be left in the classroom. I knew from a very young age that Id always have fewer auditions and this lack of opportunity was physicalised  no one needed to tell me. I knew Id be sitting in the classroom a lot if I only waited for acting jobs. How did she cope with the other pressures of stage school at such a young age? It was hard, and brilliant in equal measure. Its hard because you do get judged on the stage and your headteacher does tell you That wasnt good enough. Did it crush some of her classmates? Yeah, and I realised that because we had a school reunion a few years ago and some people were in therapy because of it. But it made me really tough. If someone says no, I dont accept it and thats been built in me from school. For me, a no is just a delay  its a not yet. I truly believe thats how Ive been able to sustain earning money in this industry  not because Im more talented than the other people in my class. Its my bounce-backability. That, she says, along with taking risks and always being led by her passions. Theres a Jamaican saying Nothing good comes easy, she says, as she takes a slug from her water bottle and leaves to begin her 12-hour day. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is at the Palace theatre, London from 14 October.

Michelle Gayle was 10 months into her role as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last March  and in such full swing that she was in total denial of the pandemic  when the West End closed its doors. Sitting in a chintzy backroom of the Palace theatre now, she talks in athletic terms about 12-hour rehearsal days and re-building her stamina. The whole cast is ecstatic to be back, she says, but they are also whispering about how tired they feel. Exhaustion aside, she speaks of her debt to Noma Dumezweni, whose casting in 2016 sparked online outrage from some at the prospect of a Black Hermione. JK Rowling piled in to the furore to defend the casting and call out the complaints as racist. Dumezweni won an Olivier award for the part. I owe her a lot of gratitude  Im standing on her shoulders, says Gayle. She got through that [time] with incredible grace and proved she was there on merit because shes a bloody good actress but she had to take a big hit online to do that. When someone of the quality of Noma steps up, no ones got anything more to say and then the conversations dead. Its a shame that you have to be brilliant to end that conversation, but there are enough brilliant black actors out there. We are living in a new world where diversity is on everyones agenda but does Gayle feel the industry has corrected itself significantly since last summers black square pledges to do better from theatres and TV production companies? I think people are starting to be bolder, and I think they realise that true allyship is about being bolder. As someone who began life on TV at a tender age  first in Grange Hill as a teenager in 1988 and then EastEnders  she feels that the theatre industry is ahead in the game. TV is playing catch-up and it needs to play catch-up. I think theres been reflection, but weve yet to see that reflected on screen. I believe that they will be held to account and we will not take the foot off the gas as actors of colour, because were discussing things that we shouldnt even have needed to discuss.

My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.

My brother, David de Peyer, who has died aged 87 of pneumonia, exacerbated by post-polio syndrome, was a dedicated public servant and director general of the Cancer Research Campaign. Using a wheelchair after contracting polio aged 20, he led a life of conspicuous achievement in the face of disability. Born in London, David was the son of Charles de Peyer, a civil servant, and Flora (nee Collins), a classical singer. Educated at Rendcomb college, Gloucestershire, he excelled at cross-country running and hockey. During national service in the 1950s he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force, Nigeria, where he served in Kaduna. He was proud to have been chosen to represent Nigeria in a hockey match against Ghana. During this posting David contracted polio. Although it was a cruel personal blow for a sportsman like David, his disability did not stop him getting on with life. He went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politices and economics, assisted by good friends who carried him and his wheelchair up flights of stairs for lectures. After graduating in 1959, he married Ann Harbord, whom he met when she was an English student at Oxford. He joined the civil service at the Department of Health in 1960 and became assistant secretary in 1973, dealing with the terms and conditions of hospital doctors. He was appointed secretary to the 1975 royal commission on the National Health Service and from 1979 to 1984 was under secretary at the DHSS. In 1984 he became director general of the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), a role he fulfilled with distinction until his retirement in 1996. He then continued to devote himself to public service, as vice-chairman of the Suffolk Health Authority and as a member of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. He was a trustee of the Disabled Living Foundation and of Research into Ageing. His last public role was as founder member and first chairman of the friends of the church in Middleton, a small village on the Essex/Suffolk border, where he and Ann lived after retirement. They were keen to see the church used as a centre of activities for the local community, which had few other amenities. David loved good food and wine and had a permanent suntan acquired in or by the swimming pool and from the seat of his Triumph Stag convertible. He enjoyed many highly competitive games of garden croquet and racing demon. He is survived by Ann and by his siblings, Andy, Jenny and me.

Liverpool have finalised a deal for Fabio Carvalho that will take the exciting winger from Fulham for 5m plus add-ons in the summer, ending a chase the club failed to complete on deadline day of the most recent transfer window. Carvalho was ready to swap west London for Merseyside in January after negotiations led to a 8.4m fee being agreed upon  Fulham had rejected Liverpools opening offer of 5m  but ultimately time ran out for the transfer. Jrgen Klopp never lost interest in the 19-year-old, however, and with his contract ending in the summer, was determined to sign him before he became a free agent and thus hugely attractive to rival bidders. That was relatively easy to organise given Carvalho had agreed personal terms with Liverpool, as well as completing a medical, when he appeared set to join them a little over two months ago. He will now do so on 1 July  when his contract with Fulham expires  with the transfer expected to be officially announced next month. The add-on payments will be in the region of 2.7m, with Liverpool also agreeing to a 20% sell-on fee. There are no plans for Carvalho to be loaned back to Fulham. Carvalho, who can also operate as an attacking midfielder, was born in Portugal and has played at Under-21 level for the country having been capped at Under-18 level for England. He progressed through Fulhams academy and having made his debut in a 2-0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in September 2020, quickly became a first-team regular. He has made 31 appearances for Marco Silvas side in all competitions this season, scoring eight goals and providing seven assists, and could well face Fulham next season given they appear poised for an immediate return to the Premier League as Championship champions. They are top of the division, five points clear of second-place Bournemouth and 17 points clear of third-place Huddersfield. Carvalhos contract with Liverpool will last until 2027 and he is expected to be on their pre-season tour to the far east before the 2022-23 campaign.

Frank Lampard claimed Everton were denied a blatant penalty at Anfield where a 2-0 defeat by Liverpool left his club in the relegation zone for the first time since December 2019. Liverpool maintained their title challenge with second-half headers from Andy Robertson and the substitute Divock Origi but had to overcome an obstinate Everton. In the 53rd minute, with the game goalless, Anthony Gordon went down in the Liverpool penalty area under an apparent push by Jol Matip. He retweeted footage of the incident along with two emojis expressing his disbelief. The referee, Stuart Attwell, who had booked Gordon for diving in the first half, awarded neither a spotkick nor a second yellow card. It is a penalty for me, said Lampard, who has lost all seven away matches as Everton manager. You dont get them here. If that was Mo Salah at the other end he gets a penalty. Im not trying to create conflict; its just the reality of football. I have played in teams in the top half of the league  you get them. That was a penalty for sure. Its a clear foul. Everton, who dropped into the bottom three after Burnley beat Wolves, have six games remaining to avoid a first relegation since 1951. Lampard insisted his players could take heart from their Anfield display: It was a good performance against a difficult opponent. You have seen their recent games  we had to have a plan to stop them getting space and for 60 minutes we did that as well as you can. We did it with great discipline and created the best chances until that point. But a moment of brilliance from Mo Salah and an overhead kick [from Luis Daz to set up the second goal] are difficult to combat. Jrgen Klopp reserved praise for Origi after the strikers sixth goal against Everton secured a victory that took Liverpool back to within a point of Manchester City at the top. The Liverpool manager said: He is a legend on and off the pitch. He is a fantastic footballer for me, and I know it sounds ridiculous as I dont line him up often, he is a world-class striker. He is our best finisher definitely. He always was and everybody would say the same. When you see him do these kind of things in training, then you see the quality of the squad and other players and its really hard I imagine [for him]. I have really hard decisions to make because the boys all want to contribute and are responsible for the situation we are in. Everybody loves Div and rightly so. He was again very decisive. Im very, very happy for him.

Ralf Rangnick has acknowledged that Mason Greenwoods arrest was discussed by Manchester United players but said the squad had trained well this week. Greenwood was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of rape and assault and further arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill. The forward was released on bail on Wednesday. He remains under investigation and is suspended from training and playing for United until further notice. Rangnick, whose team host Middlesbrough in Fridays fourth-round FA Cup tie, was asked whether this had been a difficult few days because of the situation with Greenwood. We had a normal week of training with five training sessions including todays training, Rangnick said. Obviously it was a topic within the team but theyre human beings and Mason was part of the group before we had our [winter] break. We are looking forward to the game. We had internal discussions but Im pretty sure everyone will understand those internal discussions should stay internal. Its an unusual situation for everybody. Rangnick stated that Jesse Lingard staying rather than leaving on loan was due partly to Greenwoods unavailability. In a way, yes, he said. We had a problem with Mason Greenwood and being without a player for the time being who has played in [recent] weeks and, together with the club not finding an agreement with another club [for Lingard], this is why he stayed. Three weeks ago Jesse didnt want to leave, then changed his mind. If he shows up [performs well] in training he has all the chances to get game time here. Lingard, unhappy at not going on loan, had requested time off according to Rangnick. Jesse asked if we could give him a couple of days to clear his mind, the interim manager said. He will be back in training on Monday and part of the squad. Yet on Thursday evening Lingard seemed to dispute Rangnicks claim. In a tweet he said: The club advised me to have time off due to personal reasons! But my headspace is clear and Ill always be professional when called upon and give 100 percent. Paul Pogba may start against Middlesbrough after recovering from a calf injury that has ruled out the midfielder for three months. He might be in the XI, said Rangnick. Ill be excited myself to see how Paul is doing. For me he is now a new player and can show me and the team and the fans and everyone in England what high level he can play. Lets just wait and see what he can show. Edinson Cavani has been granted time off after playing for Uruguay and Alex Telles will also not feature against Middlesbrough after playing for Brazil, so Luke Shaw will start. Victor Lindelf misses out with an illness and Eric Bailly has an ankle injury that rules him out. United have confirmed that fans can exchange a shirt with Greenwoods name on the back for a replacement with another players name.

Ralf Rangnick has acknowledged that Mason Greenwoods arrest was discussed by Manchester United players but said the squad had trained well this week. Greenwood was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of rape and assault and further arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill. The forward was released on bail on Wednesday. He remains under investigation and is suspended from training and playing for United until further notice. Rangnick, whose team host Middlesbrough in Fridays fourth-round FA Cup tie, was asked whether this had been a difficult few days because of the situation with Greenwood. We had a normal week of training with five training sessions including todays training, Rangnick said. Obviously it was a topic within the team but theyre human beings and Mason was part of the group before we had our [winter] break. We are looking forward to the game. We had internal discussions but Im pretty sure everyone will understand those internal discussions should stay internal. Its an unusual situation for everybody. Rangnick stated that Jesse Lingard staying rather than leaving on loan was due partly to Greenwoods unavailability. In a way, yes, he said. We had a problem with Mason Greenwood and being without a player for the time being who has played in [recent] weeks and, together with the club not finding an agreement with another club [for Lingard], this is why he stayed. Three weeks ago Jesse didnt want to leave, then changed his mind. If he shows up [performs well] in training he has all the chances to get game time here. Lingard, unhappy at not going on loan, had requested time off according to Rangnick. Jesse asked if we could give him a couple of days to clear his mind, the interim manager said. He will be back in training on Monday and part of the squad. Yet on Thursday evening Lingard seemed to dispute Rangnicks claim. In a tweet he said: The club advised me to have time off due to personal reasons! But my headspace is clear and Ill always be professional when called upon and give 100 percent.

Its going to sound bad, as if I am glamorising it, but it was normal, Troy Deeney says when he remembers being driven around by his father in a stolen Mercedes-Benz with a drug dealer locked up in the boot. Deeney was just 19 years old and he had played one of his earliest games of professional football for Walsall against Northampton Town. He was a dozen years away from becoming the Premier League football captain who would do so much to force debate around how leading clubs in England could confront enduring racism. Early in 2009, however, Deeney was simply puzzled by another outbreak of chaos in his life. Hearing the hammering and screaming in the boot of the car he turned to his father when they stopped for petrol. Can you hear that noise, Dad? he asked. His father, whom Deeney revered even though he was such a violent man who was in and out of prison, shrugged. Dont worry. Ill drop him off in a bit. The kidnapped man was a drug dealer who owed money to a friend of Deeneys dad. Having filled the stolen car with petrol, and cranked up the music to drown out the commotion, Deeneys father smiled. Ive fed him and hes fine. Well drop him off later and I bet he pays. On a quiet October morning, deep in the midst of a long and involving interview about his life and powerful new book, Deeney is still trying to make sense of his traumatised past. Of course its not normal to have someone in the boot but it was normal for us with our mad destiny. My dad never had a driving licence so for him to turn up in a blue Mercedes ? Deeney puffs out his cheeks and laughs softly. It had reached that point when you just went: Dad, I dont even want to know. The only thing I wanted to know is: Am I going to get in trouble? My dad said: No, no, its my mates car, its fine. I now think: Fucking hell, how mad was that life I used to live? Im so boring now. I go to work and play with the kids. I walk the dogs. Thats as fascinating as my life gets now. Its just a normal, generic, day-to-day life. But, yeah, the time before this was a bit strange. After 11 years and 419 games at Watford, where he became their captain and one of the most outspoken and honest voices in English football, Deeney was transferred to Birmingham City, his hometown club, this summer. It was in Birmingham, during the darkest period of his life in the summer of 2012, that Deeney knew he had to change. His dad, Paul Burke, who was his adoptive father and an infamous gangster in Birmingham, was buried on a Friday that June. On the following Monday, Deeney began a 10-month prison sentence for kicking a student in the head after a late-night altercation in Birmingham. He and his mother, Emma Deeney, had often been terrified of Burke and the turmoil of their lives sparked the subsequent drinking and violence that led to Deeney ending up in jail. It is a subject he addresses in his book and, as he says now: How many interviews have I done over the years? It always comes up. I could be talking about Asda and somebody will say: You went to jail so lets talk about that. But theres another person on the other end of that [street fight] who is living their trauma through something I did. Every time he reads about me there is another reminder. What I did was wrong, which is why I wrote about it, so please can we close that book now? Deeney is more interested in examining the reasons which led to his imprisonment and discussing how he has used therapy to transform his life. His biological father had abandoned Deeney and his mother soon after his birth and that rejection eroded his self-esteem. In contrast, he says, Burkes willingness to become his adoptive father was rooted in love despite the brutal mayhem of his criminal life. It is a typically surreal footnote in Deeneys past that, on the day of the funeral, his biological father suddenly turned up to be the DJ at Burkes wake. I call that the Deeney effect, he says wryly. My biological dad [whom Deeney loathes] is friends with my dads youngest brother. Its all fucked up. I was one of the last people to arrive [at the wake] because I was at the grave. I walk in and hes there. My biological dad, who I havent seen in years, is also the DJ. Hes the last fucking person I wanted to see but, because my mum was cool and didnt make a fuss, I stayed quiet. As a family we dont talk to each other. Were from a Jamaican and Irish background where no one speaks. So one reason to write the book was to hopefully spark a conversation within the family. Ive done a lot of therapy, 12 years of it, and I know we need to talk. My [younger] brother came over on Sunday and this sums it up. When my dad died he suppressed it totally. But I gave him the book and after the first two chapters he said: I never knew so much of this. But he could remember the CS gas the police used when they arrested our dad in the house. So that sparked a conversation between us that we never would have had  and that has to be good. Deeney is admirably open about how his life has been gradually transformed by therapy. I still see two therapists because Im getting into the nitty-gritty now. There are layers in that blackened onion that you keep peeling back until you find the root cause  and for me a lot of my trauma is to do with rejection. My missus said: Im starting to understand why you cant cry. Its because I never saw my mum cry from all the things she went through. So why should I cry? Im also from a generation where theyd say: Ill give you something to cry about. You cut yourself off emotionally. But I dont want my kids to see that as normal. I want my kids to be in touch with their emotions. Im 33 and its emotionally draining carrying that baggage. Beyond counselling, and his long and successful career as a reformed footballer, Deeney has also been calmed by having a purpose in speaking out against racism. At last years meeting between Premier League club captains, as they discussed how to resume football after the first lockdown, racial discrimination was the fifth and last item on the agenda. As the meeting on Zoom approached the end it looked as if racism, which had become global news after the murder of George Floyd, would not be discussed in any detail. It was Deeney, as Watfords captain, who spoke up. He took over the Zoom call with, as he says now, a big rant. It had a galvanising impact and led to players taking the knee and wearing the Black Lives Matter slogan on their shirts. It was not through a lack of them wanting to do something but more a case of how do we spark that conversation, Deeney explains. Apart from the footballers on that call we had Premier League officials who are middle-aged white guys. They dont want to say the wrong thing, or take the lead, and Im totally cool with that. I fully understand. But the whole time nothing was being said I was texting Wes Morgan [Leicester Citys captain]. Im hot-headed so I was like: Im going in here. Will you follow me? He was like: Yeah, no probs. I called it a rant but really it was an articulated discussion of why we needed to do something. Samus Coleman, of Everton, was the first captain to offer his support. Kevin De Bruyne then said: Im with Troy. Jordan Henderson echoed those simple words. That gave me immense pride, Deeney says. Ive been in loads of meetings since then and progress is being made. Is it as fast as I would like? Of course not. Deeney suggests that some footballers are so fed up with racist abuse that they are close to boiling point. I dont want to say black footballers because lots of white footballers are socially aware. The dressing-room conversation has completely changed. Ten years ago it was football, horses, poker, the generic stuff. Now the conversation can be about Sarah Everard, racism or the political situation in Germany. Were talking about real stuff at last. Are we close to a situation where a football team might walk off the pitch in the middle of a match marred by racial abuse? I honestly believe so. I think someone like Romelu Lukaku would do it. This might sound strange but look at Colin Kaepernick. He started the most significant peaceful protest in a long time by taking the knee. He was ostracised but look at how successful hes become off the back of it. So if a really big footballer walked off? Wow, that would be really powerful. I saw Marcos Alonso saying hes not taking the knee because its losing its power. Thats a fair comment. Why is it losing its power? Because nothing is really changing on social media. I get eight or nine [racial insults] a day. Let me get up one when I was having a little rant online. Deeney reaches for his phone and finds the tweet. It says: Youre a black cunt. Comes from a man called Sam. Anton Ferdinand and I and a few others were in talks with Twitter about how can we not have verification of users? We need Covid passports, and ID to buy cigarettes or alcohol. But you can go online, racially abuse someone, delete that account, make another one, do the same thing again and go, boom, boom, boom. Social media platforms are getting away with it. Twitter say theyre only providing the platform and they cant control what is said between me and some guy called Sam. I find that baffling. Ive been called a nigger and a black cunt on there and they say they cant change those words. But if you say Covid isnt real on Instagram it comes up as a factfinder. It would show everybody my statement is false. There is a little toolbar at the bottom you can click on which gives you more informed advice on Covid. But ask them to take down the words nigger and black cunt, and call it abusive hate crime? Thats too difficult for them to do. I call bullshit on it. Deeney is rightly passionate but he is also amusing and calm. Im getting there. I hope all this is a step forward to understanding I have a purpose in life, not just as a footballer. Hopefully conversations like these will move the needle forward and also give people a better understanding of who I am. Redemption by Troy Deeney is published by Hamlyn www.octopusbooks.co.uk

Marsh was sacked as a federal government mens health ambassador in 2008 after he refused to distance himself from some of the claims in a report he co-authored that claimed homosexuality is a mental disorder. He has denied being homophobic and said previously there is a war on men and that the gender pay gap is a myth. Stoker spoke about her campaign to return to the Senate, having been bumped to third on the Liberal National partys ticket in Queensland, leaving her in serious danger of not returning to the federal parliament. Warwick, thank you for your friendship all throughout my opportunity to serve, she said. The video of the interview has been watched about 400 times on Facebook  even fewer on YouTube. Such marginal viewership might lead voters to wonder why Stoker would court controversy  and waste 20 minutes of her time  speaking to Marsh. But it is typical of the way Stoker is fighting to retain her seat, narrowcasting to rightwing Christian causes and voters flirting with fringe parties, in a campaign that puts her (from the No 3 spot on the ticket) front and centre of view. Stoker has spent more than $60,000 on Facebook advertising in the weeks before election day  vastly outspending most other Senate candidates. Many of her posts are targeted directly at the news feeds of older people, particularly older women. One of those was a spend of between $3,500 and $4,000 to promote a Facebook post from 5 May, which showed her speaking at an anti-abortion rally in Brisbane. The group that hosted the rally, Cherish Life, was last week accused by a Labor MP of running a disgusting smear campaign, which claimed Labor wants to enact an extreme abortion agenda, something the party denies. Cherish Life has said it stands by the campaign and has released its own how-to-vote cards urging its supporters to vote for Stoker and other anti-abortion candidates below the line. The Australian Christian Lobby, in an interview with Stoker, also urged people of faith to vote below the line. Queenslands Senate race is hotly contested this year, with the Greens, Clive Palmer, One Nation and the former premier Campbell Newman all seeking to challenge the major parties for the six spots. Dr Glenn Kefford, a political scientist at the University of Queensland, says the LNP will almost certainly win two Senate seats meaning James McGrath and Matt Canavan, who are in the top spots on the ticket, will be elected. Kefford says Stokers strategy of speaking directly to rightwing Christian voters would be a deliberate attempt to encourage them to vote for her below the line on the Senate ballot paper. Unless shes running a completely rogue campaign, which is unlikely, shed have been given a tick off to run a differentiated strategy from the rest of the ticket, to really harvest the vote of the Christian right in Queensland, Kefford said. Kefford said the strategy was similar to the one employed by the Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz, who finds himself at risk and is encouraging people to vote for him below the line. Thats really the strategy  similar to what Abetz has done, to persuade voters that she has a political niche and to vote for her below the line. It does set her apart from the other LNP candidates. We know that theres a real strengthening within the LNP of the Christian right and its an attempt to narrowcast to that base  to differentiate herself from the rest of the ticket. During the election campaign Stoker has been interviewed online by the Australian Christian Lobby and appeared at the groups Gold Coast politics forum, where she was introduced as a legend. In recent months she has published paid social media advertisements saying she supports conservative, family values and spoken at a Sunday service at one of Brisbanes biggest evangelical churches, Gateway. Stoker has spent more than $20,000 on her most recent advertisement on Facebook, seeking to link Labor to the Greens in a bid to bring rightwing voters flirting with minor parties back into the tent. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If they channel that support into the LNP, to get me up as the third in Queensland, theyll have a fighter for their values  in the room, she said. In her interview with Marsh, Stoker made what appeared to be a veiled dig at McGrath, who beat her for top spot on the ticket in a tense preselection that underscored tensions in the LNP between so-called moderates and a growing faction of Christian soldiers. Ultimately, you know, politics is a numbers game, Stoker said. This is true of anywhere in life. You succeed in the places where you invest your efforts. I invested my efforts in doing the hard policy work of the government rather than counting numbers. Its deepened my faith, my trust in God  Im really comfortable with where I am because I know that if I can deliver this then Im moving the dial in a way that I wouldnt have in a safe spot. Stoker did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about her campaign.

Edinson Cavani, whom Barcelona are reported to be interested in signing, has informed Ralf Rangnick he will not depart Manchester United during this transfer window. I told him that if it was up to me I would want him to stay and I had a conversation with him [last Thursday], the interim manager said as he prepared for Uniteds FA Cup tie at home to Aston Villa on Monday. We spoke for almost half an hour and he told me he will definitely stay and would want to stay until the end of the season. Not only because I told him that he should stay or has to stay, he did it on his own behalf, and he told me that I can rely on him to stay until the end of the season and give his very best. Hes happy to play. But even if hes not playing, he will be trying to be the best possible role model for the other players and for me this is good news because Edi is one of those players who, with his vast amount of experience, with his mentality, his work ethic, I think he could really be a perfect role model.

I told him that if it was up to me I would want him to stay and I had a conversation with him [last Thursday], the interim manager said as he prepared for Uniteds FA Cup tie at home to Aston Villa on Monday. We spoke for almost half an hour and he told me he will definitely stay and would want to stay until the end of the season. Not only because I told him that he should stay or has to stay, he did it on his own behalf, and he told me that I can rely on him to stay until the end of the season and give his very best. Hes happy to play. But even if hes not playing, he will be trying to be the best possible role model for the other players and for me this is good news because Edi is one of those players who, with his vast amount of experience, with his mentality, his work ethic, I think he could really be a perfect role model.

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here.

A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one.

Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box.

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years.

Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72.

He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed.

The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand.

He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis.

On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg.

No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork.

He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three.

So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

As first taste of European semi-finals go, this barnstorming match will surely have whet the appetite of Leicester. Ademola Lookman bundled in a second-half equaliser via Gianluca Mancini to cancel out Romas early opener and ensure a grandstand finish in the second leg of this Europa Conference League contest at the enormous Stadio Olimpico next Thursday, leaving Jos Mourinho frustrated on his return to England. The Portuguese had reeled off eight of Leicesters attacking threats in the buildup to this game and his stubborn side eventually wilted. Brendan Rodgers had eulogised about Mourinhos influence on his career during their three years together at Chelsea and, after taking the opportunity to catch up, the Leicester manager handed his opposite number a bottle of red. He got me the best Portuguese bottle of wine, Mourinho said. Hes crying because its really expensive, but he wanted to give me my favourite bottle of Portuguese wine. It is really hard to find. I dont know how he found it, but I know how he paid. The tie is finely poised but it was the kind of evening when both managers were able to smile. Mourinho is adamant Romas home advantage for the final date will help to propel them to the final and Rodgers was effusive in his praise of his youthful teams performance, with James Maddison, Wesley Fofana and Lookman lively on Jamie Vardys return to the starting lineup. The winner of the Roma final has to win the Albanian final, Mourinho said, referring to the competitions final next month in Tirana. For us it makes a difference to play at home with 70,000 [fans]. For all Leicesters early promise, Roma ruthlessly punished them with their first clean sight of goal on 15 minutes. The bubbly wing-back Nicola Zalewski surged upfield on a meandering run and after driving inside he spied the run of his captain, Lorenzo Pellegrini, who rattled a shot through the legs of the Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. In the dugout Mourinho, silver hair, grey long coat, was unmoved, steadfastly jotting down a note or two. It was not always the way, however, and the former Tottenham manager was soon crouching on the touchline, contorting himself as he cajoled his players into shape or skipping out of his technical area to deliver instructions. Vardy and Timothy Castagne, who departed after 21 minutes with a head injury, fashioned early chances but Tammy Abraham, one of two Englishmen in the Roma starting lineup along with Chris Smalling, freed Nicol Zaniolo before Fofana intervened. Mourinhos 25 titles (25 and a half, if you ask him, given he was sacked six days before Tottenham reached the Carabao Cup final last year) were crammed into the honours list in the match-day programme and how Leicester, who sent PSV packing in the previous round, crave more of these nights. Fofana occasionally took matters into his own hands, gracefully flowing forward from centre-back, and Smalling made a superb sliding block to prevent Lookman getting a clear shot at goal after he was threaded through by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Vardy lasted an hour on his return before being replaced by Kelechi Iheanacho but another substitute, Harvey Barnes, was the catalyst for Leicesters leveller. Chances had been at a premium but Barnes poured forward into a dangerous position at the byline after the Roma centre-back Roger Ibaez, trying to shield the ball from Iheanacho, inadvertently played a one-two with the Leicester winger. Barnes sent a cross into the six-yard box and Lookman was there to help it in with some help from Mancini. This stadium was now rocking but Rodgers was a picture of calm, sipping a bottle of water. Iheanacho forced the former Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patrcio to tip round a post and Schmeichel made an acrobatic stop to deny Srgio Oliveira at the other end a couple of minutes later. Maddisons cross then took a wicked deflection and a pulsating tie will resume next week. I said to the players afterwards: Look at the performance level, Rodgers said. We had no fear; we can go to Rome and play to that level. Were in with a fantastic chance to get to the final.

It was some way for West Ham to silence the doubts about their inexperience on the European stage. They answered the questions by playing like seasoned travellers. There were no stumbles from David Moyess players as they took their first steps into the unknown and in the end, with Dinamo Zagreb confounded by West Hams organisation, it was hard to tell which team were supposed to be the novices at this level. Moyes could not have asked for a more commanding away performance. West Ham were sharper and savvier throughout, their maturity and inventiveness key as they started their Europa League campaign with a memorable win. Dinamo were outplayed and had no answers to goals from Michail Antonio and Declan Rice, who killed the game as a contest with a stunning solo effort early in the second half. Rice was outstanding in midfield, excelling on his European debut, but the England international was not alone. West Ham were impeccable. This was their first appearance in the main draw of a European competition since 2006, when a side containing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were bundled out of the first round of the Uefa Cup, but there was no sign of any nerves. Sitting back was not part of the plan from West Ham, who backed themselves on a bobbly pitch, passing with crisp assurance against opponents who have humbled Arsenal and Tottenham here in recent seasons. I was really pleased, Moyes said. Zagreb have a really good history. I knew it was going to be a tough game. We made the players aware of what it would be like. Its certainly new to Declan Rice. Hes played international football for his country, but not for his club. Hes a terrific player. Playing in Europe for the 16th consecutive season, Dinamo looked put out to be pushed back in front of their boisterous fans. The Croatian champions struggled to get anything going during the first half. Quick to impose their muscular game on the hosts, West Ham were dominant. Tomas Soucek and Rice set the tone by establishing control in midfield, Aaron Cresswell and Ryan Fredericks attacked from full-back and it did not come as a surprise when the breakthrough arrived in the 21st minute, Kvin Thophile-Catherines back-pass gifting Antonio his fifth goal of the season. It was a woeful error from the former Cardiff defender, who was replaced by Deni Juric at half-time. Too fast and strong for his markers, Antonio was on to the loose ball in a flash and the striker had the composure to finish, rounding Dominik Livakovic before tapping into the empty net. Dinamo, who were knocked out of qualifying for the Champions League by Sheriff Tiraspol, could have conceded again moments later. Antonio held the ball up before releasing Fredericks and Livakovic denied West Hams right-back a rare goal by saving with his feet. At that stage the only concern for West Ham was their inability to make more of their supremacy. Dinamo were bound to improve eventually. There were flashes from Mislav Orsic, whose hat-trick stunned Spurs in the last 16 of this competition last season, and a shot from Bruno Petkovic that whistled just wide as the half drew to a close. West Ham had to concentrate at the back. Kurt Zouma, who had an impressive debut alongside Issa Diop in central defence, was in the right place to block a shot from Dinamos captain, Arijan Ademi. There was a shift in the mood, a sense that Dinamo were gearing up for a rousing fightback, and Moyes was wise to sense danger early in the second half, removing Manuel Lanzini shortly after he had risked a second booking with a lunge on Stefan Ristovski. Fortunately for Lanzini, West Ham had already doubled their lead by the time he made way for Sad Benrahma in the 52nd minute. Rice had just produced something special, surging clear after intercepting a pass intended for Petkovic near the halfway line. It was a remarkable run from West Hams captain, who shrugged Petkovic aside before rumbling into the box and firing an angled shot through Livakovics legs. Rice, making his 150th appearance for West Ham, celebrated by running to the corner and goading the fans behind Dinamos goal. Ademi was furious; West Ham were defiant. Luka Ivanusec twice went close for the hosts, sending shots just wide, but in the end the home fans were reduced to whistling the former Hajduk Split midfielder Nikola Vlasic when he made way for Jarrod Bowen.

Luka Ivanusec twice went close for the hosts, sending shots just wide, but in the end the home fans were reduced to whistling the former Hajduk Split midfielder Nikola Vlasic when he made way for Jarrod Bowen.

It was some way for West Ham to silence the doubts about their inexperience on the European stage. They answered the questions by playing like seasoned travellers. There were no stumbles from David Moyess players as they took their first steps into the unknown and in the end, with Dinamo Zagreb confounded by West Hams organisation, it was hard to tell which team were supposed to be the novices at this level. Moyes could not have asked for a more commanding away performance. West Ham were sharper and savvier throughout, their maturity and inventiveness key as they started their Europa League campaign with a memorable win. Dinamo were outplayed and had no answers to goals from Michail Antonio and Declan Rice, who killed the game as a contest with a stunning solo effort early in the second half. Rice was outstanding in midfield, excelling on his European debut, but the England international was not alone. West Ham were impeccable. This was their first appearance in the main draw of a European competition since 2006, when a side containing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were bundled out of the first round of the Uefa Cup, but there was no sign of any nerves. Sitting back was not part of the plan from West Ham, who backed themselves on a bobbly pitch, passing with crisp assurance against opponents who have humbled Arsenal and Tottenham here in recent seasons. I was really pleased, Moyes said. Zagreb have a really good history. I knew it was going to be a tough game. We made the players aware of what it would be like. Its certainly new to Declan Rice. Hes played international football for his country, but not for his club. Hes a terrific player. Playing in Europe for the 16th consecutive season, Dinamo looked put out to be pushed back in front of their boisterous fans. The Croatian champions struggled to get anything going during the first half. Quick to impose their muscular game on the hosts, West Ham were dominant. Tomas Soucek and Rice set the tone by establishing control in midfield, Aaron Cresswell and Ryan Fredericks attacked from full-back and it did not come as a surprise when the breakthrough arrived in the 21st minute, Kvin Thophile-Catherines back-pass gifting Antonio his fifth goal of the season. It was a woeful error from the former Cardiff defender, who was replaced by Deni Juric at half-time. Too fast and strong for his markers, Antonio was on to the loose ball in a flash and the striker had the composure to finish, rounding Dominik Livakovic before tapping into the empty net. Dinamo, who were knocked out of qualifying for the Champions League by Sheriff Tiraspol, could have conceded again moments later. Antonio held the ball up before releasing Fredericks and Livakovic denied West Hams right-back a rare goal by saving with his feet. At that stage the only concern for West Ham was their inability to make more of their supremacy. Dinamo were bound to improve eventually. There were flashes from Mislav Orsic, whose hat-trick stunned Spurs in the last 16 of this competition last season, and a shot from Bruno Petkovic that whistled just wide as the half drew to a close. West Ham had to concentrate at the back. Kurt Zouma, who had an impressive debut alongside Issa Diop in central defence, was in the right place to block a shot from Dinamos captain, Arijan Ademi. There was a shift in the mood, a sense that Dinamo were gearing up for a rousing fightback, and Moyes was wise to sense danger early in the second half, removing Manuel Lanzini shortly after he had risked a second booking with a lunge on Stefan Ristovski. Fortunately for Lanzini, West Ham had already doubled their lead by the time he made way for Sad Benrahma in the 52nd minute. Rice had just produced something special, surging clear after intercepting a pass intended for Petkovic near the halfway line.

Rice, making his 150th appearance for West Ham, celebrated by running to the corner and goading the fans behind Dinamos goal. Ademi was furious; West Ham were defiant. Luka Ivanusec twice went close for the hosts, sending shots just wide, but in the end the home fans were reduced to whistling the former Hajduk Split midfielder Nikola Vlasic when he made way for Jarrod Bowen.

It was some way for West Ham to silence the doubts about their inexperience on the European stage. They answered the questions by playing like seasoned travellers. There were no stumbles from David Moyess players as they took their first steps into the unknown and in the end, with Dinamo Zagreb confounded by West Hams organisation, it was hard to tell which team were supposed to be the novices at this level. Moyes could not have asked for a more commanding away performance. West Ham were sharper and savvier throughout, their maturity and inventiveness key as they started their Europa League campaign with a memorable win. Dinamo were outplayed and had no answers to goals from Michail Antonio and Declan Rice, who killed the game as a contest with a stunning solo effort early in the second half. Rice was outstanding in midfield, excelling on his European debut, but the England international was not alone. West Ham were impeccable. This was their first appearance in the main draw of a European competition since 2006, when a side containing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were bundled out of the first round of the Uefa Cup, but there was no sign of any nerves. Sitting back was not part of the plan from West Ham, who backed themselves on a bobbly pitch, passing with crisp assurance against opponents who have humbled Arsenal and Tottenham here in recent seasons. I was really pleased, Moyes said. Zagreb have a really good history. I knew it was going to be a tough game. We made the players aware of what it would be like. Its certainly new to Declan Rice. Hes played international football for his country, but not for his club. Hes a terrific player. Playing in Europe for the 16th consecutive season, Dinamo looked put out to be pushed back in front of their boisterous fans. The Croatian champions struggled to get anything going during the first half. Quick to impose their muscular game on the hosts, West Ham were dominant. Tomas Soucek and Rice set the tone by establishing control in midfield, Aaron Cresswell and Ryan Fredericks attacked from full-back and it did not come as a surprise when the breakthrough arrived in the 21st minute, Kvin Thophile-Catherines back-pass gifting Antonio his fifth goal of the season. It was a woeful error from the former Cardiff defender, who was replaced by Deni Juric at half-time. Too fast and strong for his markers, Antonio was on to the loose ball in a flash and the striker had the composure to finish, rounding Dominik Livakovic before tapping into the empty net. Dinamo, who were knocked out of qualifying for the Champions League by Sheriff Tiraspol, could have conceded again moments later. Antonio held the ball up before releasing Fredericks and Livakovic denied West Hams right-back a rare goal by saving with his feet. At that stage the only concern for West Ham was their inability to make more of their supremacy. Dinamo were bound to improve eventually. There were flashes from Mislav Orsic, whose hat-trick stunned Spurs in the last 16 of this competition last season, and a shot from Bruno Petkovic that whistled just wide as the half drew to a close. West Ham had to concentrate at the back. Kurt Zouma, who had an impressive debut alongside Issa Diop in central defence, was in the right place to block a shot from Dinamos captain, Arijan Ademi. There was a shift in the mood, a sense that Dinamo were gearing up for a rousing fightback, and Moyes was wise to sense danger early in the second half, removing Manuel Lanzini shortly after he had risked a second booking with a lunge on Stefan Ristovski. Fortunately for Lanzini, West Ham had already doubled their lead by the time he made way for Sad Benrahma in the 52nd minute.

Rice had just produced something special, surging clear after intercepting a pass intended for Petkovic near the halfway line. It was a remarkable run from West Hams captain, who shrugged Petkovic aside before rumbling into the box and firing an angled shot through Livakovics legs. Rice, making his 150th appearance for West Ham, celebrated by running to the corner and goading the fans behind Dinamos goal. Ademi was furious; West Ham were defiant. Luka Ivanusec twice went close for the hosts, sending shots just wide, but in the end the home fans were reduced to whistling the former Hajduk Split midfielder Nikola Vlasic when he made way for Jarrod Bowen.

It was some way for West Ham to silence the doubts about their inexperience on the European stage. They answered the questions by playing like seasoned travellers. There were no stumbles from David Moyess players as they took their first steps into the unknown and in the end, with Dinamo Zagreb confounded by West Hams organisation, it was hard to tell which team were supposed to be the novices at this level. Moyes could not have asked for a more commanding away performance. West Ham were sharper and savvier throughout, their maturity and inventiveness key as they started their Europa League campaign with a memorable win. Dinamo were outplayed and had no answers to goals from Michail Antonio and Declan Rice, who killed the game as a contest with a stunning solo effort early in the second half. Rice was outstanding in midfield, excelling on his European debut, but the England international was not alone. West Ham were impeccable. This was their first appearance in the main draw of a European competition since 2006, when a side containing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were bundled out of the first round of the Uefa Cup, but there was no sign of any nerves. Sitting back was not part of the plan from West Ham, who backed themselves on a bobbly pitch, passing with crisp assurance against opponents who have humbled Arsenal and Tottenham here in recent seasons. I was really pleased, Moyes said. Zagreb have a really good history. I knew it was going to be a tough game. We made the players aware of what it would be like. Its certainly new to Declan Rice. Hes played international football for his country, but not for his club. Hes a terrific player. Playing in Europe for the 16th consecutive season, Dinamo looked put out to be pushed back in front of their boisterous fans. The Croatian champions struggled to get anything going during the first half. Quick to impose their muscular game on the hosts, West Ham were dominant. Tomas Soucek and Rice set the tone by establishing control in midfield, Aaron Cresswell and Ryan Fredericks attacked from full-back and it did not come as a surprise when the breakthrough arrived in the 21st minute, Kvin Thophile-Catherines back-pass gifting Antonio his fifth goal of the season. It was a woeful error from the former Cardiff defender, who was replaced by Deni Juric at half-time. Too fast and strong for his markers, Antonio was on to the loose ball in a flash and the striker had the composure to finish, rounding Dominik Livakovic before tapping into the empty net. Dinamo, who were knocked out of qualifying for the Champions League by Sheriff Tiraspol, could have conceded again moments later. Antonio held the ball up before releasing Fredericks and Livakovic denied West Hams right-back a rare goal by saving with his feet. At that stage the only concern for West Ham was their inability to make more of their supremacy. Dinamo were bound to improve eventually. There were flashes from Mislav Orsic, whose hat-trick stunned Spurs in the last 16 of this competition last season, and a shot from Bruno Petkovic that whistled just wide as the half drew to a close. West Ham had to concentrate at the back. Kurt Zouma, who had an impressive debut alongside Issa Diop in central defence, was in the right place to block a shot from Dinamos captain, Arijan Ademi.

There was a shift in the mood, a sense that Dinamo were gearing up for a rousing fightback, and Moyes was wise to sense danger early in the second half, removing Manuel Lanzini shortly after he had risked a second booking with a lunge on Stefan Ristovski. Fortunately for Lanzini, West Ham had already doubled their lead by the time he made way for Sad Benrahma in the 52nd minute. Rice had just produced something special, surging clear after intercepting a pass intended for Petkovic near the halfway line. It was a remarkable run from West Hams captain, who shrugged Petkovic aside before rumbling into the box and firing an angled shot through Livakovics legs. Rice, making his 150th appearance for West Ham, celebrated by running to the corner and goading the fans behind Dinamos goal. Ademi was furious; West Ham were defiant. Luka Ivanusec twice went close for the hosts, sending shots just wide, but in the end the home fans were reduced to whistling the former Hajduk Split midfielder Nikola Vlasic when he made way for Jarrod Bowen.

It was some way for West Ham to silence the doubts about their inexperience on the European stage. They answered the questions by playing like seasoned travellers. There were no stumbles from David Moyess players as they took their first steps into the unknown and in the end, with Dinamo Zagreb confounded by West Hams organisation, it was hard to tell which team were supposed to be the novices at this level. Moyes could not have asked for a more commanding away performance. West Ham were sharper and savvier throughout, their maturity and inventiveness key as they started their Europa League campaign with a memorable win. Dinamo were outplayed and had no answers to goals from Michail Antonio and Declan Rice, who killed the game as a contest with a stunning solo effort early in the second half. Rice was outstanding in midfield, excelling on his European debut, but the England international was not alone. West Ham were impeccable. This was their first appearance in the main draw of a European competition since 2006, when a side containing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were bundled out of the first round of the Uefa Cup, but there was no sign of any nerves. Sitting back was not part of the plan from West Ham, who backed themselves on a bobbly pitch, passing with crisp assurance against opponents who have humbled Arsenal and Tottenham here in recent seasons. I was really pleased, Moyes said. Zagreb have a really good history. I knew it was going to be a tough game. We made the players aware of what it would be like. Its certainly new to Declan Rice. Hes played international football for his country, but not for his club. Hes a terrific player. Playing in Europe for the 16th consecutive season, Dinamo looked put out to be pushed back in front of their boisterous fans. The Croatian champions struggled to get anything going during the first half. Quick to impose their muscular game on the hosts, West Ham were dominant. Tomas Soucek and Rice set the tone by establishing control in midfield, Aaron Cresswell and Ryan Fredericks attacked from full-back and it did not come as a surprise when the breakthrough arrived in the 21st minute, Kvin Thophile-Catherines back-pass gifting Antonio his fifth goal of the season. It was a woeful error from the former Cardiff defender, who was replaced by Deni Juric at half-time. Too fast and strong for his markers, Antonio was on to the loose ball in a flash and the striker had the composure to finish, rounding Dominik Livakovic before tapping into the empty net. Dinamo, who were knocked out of qualifying for the Champions League by Sheriff Tiraspol, could have conceded again moments later. Antonio held the ball up before releasing Fredericks and Livakovic denied West Hams right-back a rare goal by saving with his feet. At that stage the only concern for West Ham was their inability to make more of their supremacy. Dinamo were bound to improve eventually.

In a week dominated by talk of forwards moving for 100m Leicester City hope to show in the Community Shield that they have landed themselves another bargain. The club who have been the Premier Leagues savviest recruiters in recent seasons pounced at the end of the last campaign to prise Patson Daka from Red Bull Salzburg for 23m, a deal that will come to be regarded as a steal if the striker fulfils his lavish potential. He is likely to get a chance to introduce himself to English football at Wembley on Saturday. At 22 Daka should have his best years in front of him but already has encouraging pedigree. He made his debut for Zambia at 16 and arrives at Leicester after helping Salzburg to win the Austrian title four years in a row. That title-winning knowhow can only enrich a Leicester side aiming to reverse the trend of the past two seasons by finishing their next Premier League campaign on a high. But Dakas playing attributes are the most exciting thing about him, raising hopes that he and the club are set for a beautiful future together. The player whose goals helped Salzburg thrive after selling Erling Haaland to Dortmund in 2019 may ultimately allow Leicester to envisage success without Jamie Vardy. But the plan for this season is even better: success with Vardy and Daka, as well as Kelechi Iheanacho, whose performances in the second half of last season make it reasonable to say that the FA Cup holders go into this campaign with three high-class strikers, giving Rodgers more firepower than at any time since he joined Leicester two and a half years ago. Dakas arrival gives the manager greater freedom to choose when to deploy Vardy, who turns 35 in January. That was the whole reason for bringing Patson in, says Rodgers. He is very similar to Jamie in his traits. He wants to run off the backline, hes a great finisher and all of those players  Patson, Jamie and Kels  were going to need all of them. Its a long season, hopefully lots of games, and theres not one of them whos going to play in every single game. You want to be able to maximise their talents, bring them on in games, start them in games. Bringing Patson in gives us that extra flexibility to do that. Daka has demonstrated his speed and skills at Leicester in pre-season and scored his first goal for the club in last months friendly at Queens Park Rangers. As a player hes everything we thought, says Rodgers. He wants to run in behind and he works his socks off, which is important in a team like ourselves. He presses, he runs and, as seen with his goal at QPR, as soon as the ball is in front of him he just becomes totally natural. Theres no hesitation, he just finishes. Hes fast but speed is also in the brain  thats where you need it  and thankfully he is a thinker as well. Along with the other new signings [the midfielder Boubakary Soumar from Lille and defender Ryan Bertrand from Southampton], he is really going to help the team. Of course, the sight of a potential heir does not mean Vardy is ready to surrender his throne. Rodgers says that Leicesters most prolific scorer of the Premier League era has looked as sharp as ever in pre-season. Theres individual programmes for every player and Jamies, of course, will be different from someone who is 17 or 18 but in pre-season hes been first-class, says Rodgers. Hes been at the front in some of the running weve done in pre-season and when you see his body you can see hes in great condition. Leicesters hope is that the veteran and the young gun will feed off each other. Sometimes competition is the best coach, says Rodgers. You can coach players to do certain things but sometimes the best coaches are the players themselves. Jamies a very unselfish player so he will look on [Daka] as someone to come in and support if the squad and team are to achieve what we want to achieve this season. Bringing in someone of that quality will certainly help Jamie but ultimately it will help the squad.

Leicesters hope is that the veteran and the young gun will feed off each other. Sometimes competition is the best coach, says Rodgers. You can coach players to do certain things but sometimes the best coaches are the players themselves. Jamies a very unselfish player so he will look on [Daka] as someone to come in and support if the squad and team are to achieve what we want to achieve this season. Bringing in someone of that quality will certainly help Jamie but ultimately it will help the squad.

In a week dominated by talk of forwards moving for 100m Leicester City hope to show in the Community Shield that they have landed themselves another bargain. The club who have been the Premier Leagues savviest recruiters in recent seasons pounced at the end of the last campaign to prise Patson Daka from Red Bull Salzburg for 23m, a deal that will come to be regarded as a steal if the striker fulfils his lavish potential. He is likely to get a chance to introduce himself to English football at Wembley on Saturday. At 22 Daka should have his best years in front of him but already has encouraging pedigree. He made his debut for Zambia at 16 and arrives at Leicester after helping Salzburg to win the Austrian title four years in a row. That title-winning knowhow can only enrich a Leicester side aiming to reverse the trend of the past two seasons by finishing their next Premier League campaign on a high. But Dakas playing attributes are the most exciting thing about him, raising hopes that he and the club are set for a beautiful future together. The player whose goals helped Salzburg thrive after selling Erling Haaland to Dortmund in 2019 may ultimately allow Leicester to envisage success without Jamie Vardy. But the plan for this season is even better: success with Vardy and Daka, as well as Kelechi Iheanacho, whose performances in the second half of last season make it reasonable to say that the FA Cup holders go into this campaign with three high-class strikers, giving Rodgers more firepower than at any time since he joined Leicester two and a half years ago. Dakas arrival gives the manager greater freedom to choose when to deploy Vardy, who turns 35 in January. That was the whole reason for bringing Patson in, says Rodgers. He is very similar to Jamie in his traits. He wants to run off the backline, hes a great finisher and all of those players  Patson, Jamie and Kels  were going to need all of them. Its a long season, hopefully lots of games, and theres not one of them whos going to play in every single game. You want to be able to maximise their talents, bring them on in games, start them in games. Bringing Patson in gives us that extra flexibility to do that. Daka has demonstrated his speed and skills at Leicester in pre-season and scored his first goal for the club in last months friendly at Queens Park Rangers. As a player hes everything we thought, says Rodgers. He wants to run in behind and he works his socks off, which is important in a team like ourselves. He presses, he runs and, as seen with his goal at QPR, as soon as the ball is in front of him he just becomes totally natural. Theres no hesitation, he just finishes. Hes fast but speed is also in the brain  thats where you need it  and thankfully he is a thinker as well. Along with the other new signings [the midfielder Boubakary Soumar from Lille and defender Ryan Bertrand from Southampton], he is really going to help the team. Of course, the sight of a potential heir does not mean Vardy is ready to surrender his throne. Rodgers says that Leicesters most prolific scorer of the Premier League era has looked as sharp as ever in pre-season. Theres individual programmes for every player and Jamies, of course, will be different from someone who is 17 or 18 but in pre-season hes been first-class, says Rodgers.

But the plan for this season is even better: success with Vardy and Daka, as well as Kelechi Iheanacho, whose performances in the second half of last season make it reasonable to say that the FA Cup holders go into this campaign with three high-class strikers, giving Rodgers more firepower than at any time since he joined Leicester two and a half years ago. Dakas arrival gives the manager greater freedom to choose when to deploy Vardy, who turns 35 in January. That was the whole reason for bringing Patson in, says Rodgers. He is very similar to Jamie in his traits. He wants to run off the backline, hes a great finisher and all of those players  Patson, Jamie and Kels  were going to need all of them. Its a long season, hopefully lots of games, and theres not one of them whos going to play in every single game. You want to be able to maximise their talents, bring them on in games, start them in games. Bringing Patson in gives us that extra flexibility to do that. Daka has demonstrated his speed and skills at Leicester in pre-season and scored his first goal for the club in last months friendly at Queens Park Rangers. As a player hes everything we thought, says Rodgers. He wants to run in behind and he works his socks off, which is important in a team like ourselves. He presses, he runs and, as seen with his goal at QPR, as soon as the ball is in front of him he just becomes totally natural. Theres no hesitation, he just finishes. Hes fast but speed is also in the brain  thats where you need it  and thankfully he is a thinker as well. Along with the other new signings [the midfielder Boubakary Soumar from Lille and defender Ryan Bertrand from Southampton], he is really going to help the team. Of course, the sight of a potential heir does not mean Vardy is ready to surrender his throne. Rodgers says that Leicesters most prolific scorer of the Premier League era has looked as sharp as ever in pre-season. Theres individual programmes for every player and Jamies, of course, will be different from someone who is 17 or 18 but in pre-season hes been first-class, says Rodgers. Hes been at the front in some of the running weve done in pre-season and when you see his body you can see hes in great condition. Leicesters hope is that the veteran and the young gun will feed off each other. Sometimes competition is the best coach, says Rodgers. You can coach players to do certain things but sometimes the best coaches are the players themselves. Jamies a very unselfish player so he will look on [Daka] as someone to come in and support if the squad and team are to achieve what we want to achieve this season. Bringing in someone of that quality will certainly help Jamie but ultimately it will help the squad.

In a week dominated by talk of forwards moving for 100m Leicester City hope to show in the Community Shield that they have landed themselves another bargain. The club who have been the Premier Leagues savviest recruiters in recent seasons pounced at the end of the last campaign to prise Patson Daka from Red Bull Salzburg for 23m, a deal that will come to be regarded as a steal if the striker fulfils his lavish potential. He is likely to get a chance to introduce himself to English football at Wembley on Saturday. At 22 Daka should have his best years in front of him but already has encouraging pedigree. He made his debut for Zambia at 16 and arrives at Leicester after helping Salzburg to win the Austrian title four years in a row.

Leicesters hope is that the veteran and the young gun will feed off each other. Sometimes competition is the best coach, says Rodgers. You can coach players to do certain things but sometimes the best coaches are the players themselves. Jamies a very unselfish player so he will look on [Daka] as someone to come in and support if the squad and team are to achieve what we want to achieve this season. Bringing in someone of that quality will certainly help Jamie but ultimately it will help the squad.

In a week dominated by talk of forwards moving for 100m Leicester City hope to show in the Community Shield that they have landed themselves another bargain. The club who have been the Premier Leagues savviest recruiters in recent seasons pounced at the end of the last campaign to prise Patson Daka from Red Bull Salzburg for 23m, a deal that will come to be regarded as a steal if the striker fulfils his lavish potential. He is likely to get a chance to introduce himself to English football at Wembley on Saturday. At 22 Daka should have his best years in front of him but already has encouraging pedigree. He made his debut for Zambia at 16 and arrives at Leicester after helping Salzburg to win the Austrian title four years in a row. That title-winning knowhow can only enrich a Leicester side aiming to reverse the trend of the past two seasons by finishing their next Premier League campaign on a high. But Dakas playing attributes are the most exciting thing about him, raising hopes that he and the club are set for a beautiful future together. The player whose goals helped Salzburg thrive after selling Erling Haaland to Dortmund in 2019 may ultimately allow Leicester to envisage success without Jamie Vardy. But the plan for this season is even better: success with Vardy and Daka, as well as Kelechi Iheanacho, whose performances in the second half of last season make it reasonable to say that the FA Cup holders go into this campaign with three high-class strikers, giving Rodgers more firepower than at any time since he joined Leicester two and a half years ago. Dakas arrival gives the manager greater freedom to choose when to deploy Vardy, who turns 35 in January. That was the whole reason for bringing Patson in, says Rodgers. He is very similar to Jamie in his traits. He wants to run off the backline, hes a great finisher and all of those players  Patson, Jamie and Kels  were going to need all of them. Its a long season, hopefully lots of games, and theres not one of them whos going to play in every single game. You want to be able to maximise their talents, bring them on in games, start them in games. Bringing Patson in gives us that extra flexibility to do that. Daka has demonstrated his speed and skills at Leicester in pre-season and scored his first goal for the club in last months friendly at Queens Park Rangers. As a player hes everything we thought, says Rodgers. He wants to run in behind and he works his socks off, which is important in a team like ourselves. He presses, he runs and, as seen with his goal at QPR, as soon as the ball is in front of him he just becomes totally natural. Theres no hesitation, he just finishes. Hes fast but speed is also in the brain  thats where you need it  and thankfully he is a thinker as well. Along with the other new signings [the midfielder Boubakary Soumar from Lille and defender Ryan Bertrand from Southampton], he is really going to help the team. Of course, the sight of a potential heir does not mean Vardy is ready to surrender his throne. Rodgers says that Leicesters most prolific scorer of the Premier League era has looked as sharp as ever in pre-season. Theres individual programmes for every player and Jamies, of course, will be different from someone who is 17 or 18 but in pre-season hes been first-class, says Rodgers.

But the plan for this season is even better: success with Vardy and Daka, as well as Kelechi Iheanacho, whose performances in the second half of last season make it reasonable to say that the FA Cup holders go into this campaign with three high-class strikers, giving Rodgers more firepower than at any time since he joined Leicester two and a half years ago. Dakas arrival gives the manager greater freedom to choose when to deploy Vardy, who turns 35 in January. That was the whole reason for bringing Patson in, says Rodgers. He is very similar to Jamie in his traits. He wants to run off the backline, hes a great finisher and all of those players  Patson, Jamie and Kels  were going to need all of them. Its a long season, hopefully lots of games, and theres not one of them whos going to play in every single game. You want to be able to maximise their talents, bring them on in games, start them in games. Bringing Patson in gives us that extra flexibility to do that. Daka has demonstrated his speed and skills at Leicester in pre-season and scored his first goal for the club in last months friendly at Queens Park Rangers. As a player hes everything we thought, says Rodgers. He wants to run in behind and he works his socks off, which is important in a team like ourselves. He presses, he runs and, as seen with his goal at QPR, as soon as the ball is in front of him he just becomes totally natural. Theres no hesitation, he just finishes. Hes fast but speed is also in the brain  thats where you need it  and thankfully he is a thinker as well. Along with the other new signings [the midfielder Boubakary Soumar from Lille and defender Ryan Bertrand from Southampton], he is really going to help the team. Of course, the sight of a potential heir does not mean Vardy is ready to surrender his throne. Rodgers says that Leicesters most prolific scorer of the Premier League era has looked as sharp as ever in pre-season. Theres individual programmes for every player and Jamies, of course, will be different from someone who is 17 or 18 but in pre-season hes been first-class, says Rodgers. Hes been at the front in some of the running weve done in pre-season and when you see his body you can see hes in great condition. Leicesters hope is that the veteran and the young gun will feed off each other. Sometimes competition is the best coach, says Rodgers. You can coach players to do certain things but sometimes the best coaches are the players themselves. Jamies a very unselfish player so he will look on [Daka] as someone to come in and support if the squad and team are to achieve what we want to achieve this season. Bringing in someone of that quality will certainly help Jamie but ultimately it will help the squad.

In a week dominated by talk of forwards moving for 100m Leicester City hope to show in the Community Shield that they have landed themselves another bargain. The club who have been the Premier Leagues savviest recruiters in recent seasons pounced at the end of the last campaign to prise Patson Daka from Red Bull Salzburg for 23m, a deal that will come to be regarded as a steal if the striker fulfils his lavish potential. He is likely to get a chance to introduce himself to English football at Wembley on Saturday. At 22 Daka should have his best years in front of him but already has encouraging pedigree. He made his debut for Zambia at 16 and arrives at Leicester after helping Salzburg to win the Austrian title four years in a row. That title-winning knowhow can only enrich a Leicester side aiming to reverse the trend of the past two seasons by finishing their next Premier League campaign on a high.

You can coach players to do certain things but sometimes the best coaches are the players themselves. Jamies a very unselfish player so he will look on [Daka] as someone to come in and support if the squad and team are to achieve what we want to achieve this season. Bringing in someone of that quality will certainly help Jamie but ultimately it will help the squad.

Anthony Martial is intent on departing Manchester United in January in pursuit of more game time, his agent has said. The forward, signed in 2015 for 36m rising to a possible 55m, has started only three Premier League or Champions League matches this season. Anthony wishes to leave the club in January, Philippe Lamboley told Sky Sports News. He just needs to play. He doesnt want to stay in January and I will speak to the club soon. Martials contract runs to June 2024 and has an option for a further year. He has not made an appearance under the interim manager, Ralf Rangnick. Rangnick, while not discussing Martial specifically, said on Friday that he would speak to unsettled players with regard to potential loans in January. Whether Martial would accept a temporary move is unclear. Rangnick said of his squad: I got to know them better this week. I saw most of them play in two games and four or five training sessions but its still too early to talk about what might happen in the winter transfer window [but] if I look at the number of players we have its still a big squad  We also need to make sure that players want to stay here. If they are still not getting enough game time here it might make sense to speak individually with the players and see if a loan might make sense. Paul Pogbas United future remains in the balance. The injured midfielders terms expire in the close season and he can agree a pre-contract deal next month. Rangnick spoke to him by phone on Tuesday and they will talk in person on Sunday. Mino Raiola, Pogbas agent, indicated the player was open to a move, but only to clubs offering comparable wages. We have many offers for him, including a contract extension, he told the German TV channel Sport1. Well see whats best for him. Asked about Bayern Munich he said: Even they cant get to Pauls salary. Germans are at the bottom of the international salary pyramid.

Anthony Martial is intent on departing Manchester United in January in pursuit of more game time, his agent has said. The forward, signed in 2015 for 36m rising to a possible 55m, has started only three Premier League or Champions League matches this season. Anthony wishes to leave the club in January, Philippe Lamboley told Sky Sports News. He just needs to play. He doesnt want to stay in January and I will speak to the club soon. Martials contract runs to June 2024 and has an option for a further year. He has not made an appearance under the interim manager, Ralf Rangnick. Rangnick, while not discussing Martial specifically, said on Friday that he would speak to unsettled players with regard to potential loans in January. Whether Martial would accept a temporary move is unclear. Rangnick said of his squad: I got to know them better this week. I saw most of them play in two games and four or five training sessions but its still too early to talk about what might happen in the winter transfer window [but] if I look at the number of players we have its still a big squad  We also need to make sure that players want to stay here. If they are still not getting enough game time here it might make sense to speak individually with the players and see if a loan might make sense. Paul Pogbas United future remains in the balance. The injured midfielders terms expire in the close season and he can agree a pre-contract deal next month. Rangnick spoke to him by phone on Tuesday and they will talk in person on Sunday. Mino Raiola, Pogbas agent, indicated the player was open to a move, but only to clubs offering comparable wages. We have many offers for him, including a contract extension, he told the German TV channel Sport1. Well see whats best for him. Asked about Bayern Munich he said: Even they cant get to Pauls salary. Germans are at the bottom of the international salary pyramid.

Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over the actors sexual abuse allegations against him. Manson, the American shock rocker born Brian Warner, filed the complaint in Los Angeles superior court on Wednesday. The complaint accuses Wood and her on-again, off-again partner Ashley Illma Gore, of depicting him as a rapist and abuser  a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warners successful music, TV, and film career. Representatives for Wood and Gore did not respond to request for comment from Deadline, which first reported the lawsuit. Wood and Gore appear in Phoenix Rising, a new documentary about Woods life and career that is scheduled to premiere on HBO this month. It also details Woods allegations against Manson. In the documentary, Wood said that during a previously discussed simulated sex scene for the music video of Mansons 2007 single Heart-Shaped Glasses, Manson started penetrating me for real and that she had never agreed to that. Wood said she was given absinthe on set, which affected her ability to refuse Mansons alleged actions. Warner has denied raping Wood on the set of the music video. In Wednesdays filing, Manson accused Wood and Gore of falsifying and spreading allegations against him. He claims they pretended to be an FBI agent by forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance that Manson was under a federal criminal investigation. Manson alleges that Wood and Gore provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner. The suit accuses Gore of trying to obtain Mansons login information to his computer, phone and email and claims that she created a fake email address to claim that Manson was sending pornography to contacts. In addition to requesting a jury trial, Manson has accused Wood of inflicting emotional distress, violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act, and impersonation over the internet. In a statement, Howard King, Mansons attorney said: Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts. But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable  and this legal action will hold them to account.

Hed hate us saying it, but when it comes to national treasures, Armando Iannucci (Scottish, but born to Italian parents) is up there with the best of them. As writer and producer for 1994s The Day Today, Iannucci was part of the Britpop of comedy: what the Gallaghers, Damon Albarn and Jarvis Cocker were doing for music, Chris Morris, Peter Baynham and Iannucci were doing for satire. Then theres a certain Mr Alan Partridge, whom Iannucci helped create with Steve Coogan for radio in the early 90s, and who now  well, who wouldnt have wanted to be invited to Partridges oasthouse for an exclusive, post-lockdown haircut interview? After creating and directing the swear-tastic The Thick of It, Iannucci brought Malcolm Fuckity Bye Tuckers political mishaps to the silver screen in 2009s tremendous In the Loop. Iannuccis second film  2017s The Death of Stalin (with Michael Palin, Steve Buscemi and Paul Whitehouse)  featured less swearing but enough communism for the Guardians Peter Bradshaw to praise it with five stars as a ruthless force by an A-list line-up  but the actual Communist Party of the Russian Federation to label it revolting and ban the film in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Iannuccis third film  the brilliant The Personal History of David Copperfield, featuring Dev Patel  was awarded four stars by Bradshaw as a bracing, entertaining, richly satisfying experience. With so much more on his CV: Veep, Avenue 5, the time he was a subject on The South Bank Show in 2006, what would you like to ask him? Post your comment below by midday on Friday 18 February and well print the answers in Film&amp;Music on Friday 25 February and online too, even if the Communist Party of the Russian Federation try to stop us. Iannucci features as one of the in conversation guests at this Marchs Glasgow film festival. He is also taking part in a Guardian Live event on 30 March, joining Zoe Williams and Jim Waterson to discuss the future of the BBC  book tickets here.

Hed hate us saying it, but when it comes to national treasures, Armando Iannucci (Scottish, but born to Italian parents) is up there with the best of them. As writer and producer for 1994s The Day Today, Iannucci was part of the Britpop of comedy: what the Gallaghers, Damon Albarn and Jarvis Cocker were doing for music, Chris Morris, Peter Baynham and Iannucci were doing for satire. Then theres a certain Mr Alan Partridge, whom Iannucci helped create with Steve Coogan for radio in the early 90s, and who now  well, who wouldnt have wanted to be invited to Partridges oasthouse for an exclusive, post-lockdown haircut interview? After creating and directing the swear-tastic The Thick of It, Iannucci brought Malcolm Fuckity Bye Tuckers political mishaps to the silver screen in 2009s tremendous In the Loop. Iannuccis second film  2017s The Death of Stalin (with Michael Palin, Steve Buscemi and Paul Whitehouse)  featured less swearing but enough communism for the Guardians Peter Bradshaw to praise it with five stars as a ruthless force by an A-list line-up  but the actual Communist Party of the Russian Federation to label it revolting and ban the film in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Iannuccis third film  the brilliant The Personal History of David Copperfield, featuring Dev Patel  was awarded four stars by Bradshaw as a bracing, entertaining, richly satisfying experience. With so much more on his CV: Veep, Avenue 5, the time he was a subject on The South Bank Show in 2006, what would you like to ask him? Post your comment below by midday on Friday 18 February and well print the answers in Film&amp;Music on Friday 25 February and online too, even if the Communist Party of the Russian Federation try to stop us. Iannucci features as one of the in conversation guests at this Marchs Glasgow film festival. He is also taking part in a Guardian Live event on 30 March, joining Zoe Williams and Jim Waterson to discuss the future of the BBC  book tickets here.

My friend Claire Watkins was an American who devoted more than 30 years to education in Wales after moving to Newport in the 1970s. As headteacher of Maindee infants school, Newport, in the 80s, she encouraged bilingualism, training other schools in the Joan Tough teaching methodologies. Maindee was the first infant school to obtain the Schools Curriculum Award, established in 1982 by the Society of Education Officers and the editorial advisory panel of Education magazine to celebrate curriculum design and teaching. Claire then became part of the Gwent county staff development unit in 1991, initially as an adviser to nursery and primary schools. In the late 90s she undertook training to be an inspector of primary schools for Estyn, the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted. Born in Houston, Texas, Claire was the daughter of Emma (nee Vestal) and Emile Emmott, a banker. She attended Bellaire high school in Houston and then Baylor University in Waco, where she obtained her BA in elementary education and English in 1963. After graduation she moved to California and married her childhood sweetheart, Alfred Hildebrand, who was studying at Stanford University, in 1964. In 1967 they moved to Darmstadt, Germany, for Alfreds work, and Claire taught primary level children at the American military school there. After two years they returned to California, where they adopted Elizabeth and Adam. Claires children attended a preschool at Stanford University that was underpinned by active research into child development by the likes of Jerome Bruner and Lilian Katz. Their work greatly influenced Claire; she later brought Katz to Wales as part of the continuing professional development of teachers. Her marriage to Alfred ended in divorce, and after Claire met Richard Watkins, a Welshman who was coaching rugby at Stanford, she moved to Newport when he returned home to study film. They married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. Claire worked in several Newport primary schools; she often spoke of her time at St Julians infants school, and she was deputy headteacher at Alway infants school. I first met Claire at Maindee in 1988, while looking for schools for my children. A qualified primary teacher myself, I was so impressed by Claire that I offered to volunteer at the school for an afternoon a week. In the next term a vacancy came up in the school for a reception class teacher and Claire strongarmed me into applying. She became a firm friend and a mentor in my career. After being brought up as a southern Baptist, Claire encountered the Quakers through her husbands family and became a devout member. While at Maindee she was also introduced to Community House, a Welsh Presbyterian church led by the Rev Cyril Summers. After she retired from teaching in 2006, she became a trustee of Community House when it became a charity. Elizabeth died in 2020. Claire is survived by Adam, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Claire then became part of the Gwent county staff development unit in 1991, initially as an adviser to nursery and primary schools. In the late 90s she undertook training to be an inspector of primary schools for Estyn, the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted. Born in Houston, Texas, Claire was the daughter of Emma (nee Vestal) and Emile Emmott, a banker. She attended Bellaire high school in Houston and then Baylor University in Waco, where she obtained her BA in elementary education and English in 1963. After graduation she moved to California and married her childhood sweetheart, Alfred Hildebrand, who was studying at Stanford University, in 1964. In 1967 they moved to Darmstadt, Germany, for Alfreds work, and Claire taught primary level children at the American military school there. After two years they returned to California, where they adopted Elizabeth and Adam. Claires children attended a preschool at Stanford University that was underpinned by active research into child development by the likes of Jerome Bruner and Lilian Katz. Their work greatly influenced Claire; she later brought Katz to Wales as part of the continuing professional development of teachers. Her marriage to Alfred ended in divorce, and after Claire met Richard Watkins, a Welshman who was coaching rugby at Stanford, she moved to Newport when he returned home to study film. They married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. Claire worked in several Newport primary schools; she often spoke of her time at St Julians infants school, and she was deputy headteacher at Alway infants school. I first met Claire at Maindee in 1988, while looking for schools for my children. A qualified primary teacher myself, I was so impressed by Claire that I offered to volunteer at the school for an afternoon a week. In the next term a vacancy came up in the school for a reception class teacher and Claire strongarmed me into applying. She became a firm friend and a mentor in my career. After being brought up as a southern Baptist, Claire encountered the Quakers through her husbands family and became a devout member. While at Maindee she was also introduced to Community House, a Welsh Presbyterian church led by the Rev Cyril Summers. After she retired from teaching in 2006, she became a trustee of Community House when it became a charity. Elizabeth died in 2020. Claire is survived by Adam, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

The temptation when Bruno Lage was appointed by Wolves was to assume it would just be more of the same: another Portuguese manager, another Jorge Mendes client, at a club with a strong Portuguese core. If managers from the German school of hard-pressing are the most modish appointment for an aspirational modern club, Portugals disciples of Vtor Frade and periodisation are not far behind. While Lage is very much of that school  to the extent that in 2012, despite being a youth coach at Benfica at the time, he co-authored a report with the former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea coach Carlos Carvalhal on the latters implementation of periodisation at Besiktas  this has been a season of change at Wolves. The result is that, even after defeat at Arsenal on Thursday, Wolves go into Sundays game at West Ham with four more points than they have had at this stage of a Premier League season. Even if they do not finish in the top four, a club that had seemed to be stagnating have been reenergised and have a good chance of their best finish since coming fifth in 1972-73. Lages report on Besiktas, Soccer: Developing a Know-How, starts in the language familiar to anybody acquainted with Frades work, rejecting the reductionism of Cartesianism and those thinkers who having an object of study  separate its various components and attempt carefully to study each one with the goal of understanding each component better. In football, that means separating the game into four basic components: tactical, technical, physical and psychological. In Tactical Periodisation, the report explains, the understanding of the tactical is different  its a dimension that assumes the coordination of the whole process involving with it all other dimensions that assume equal importance. It demonstrates itself in a specific form depending on the choice of exercises so to model our style of playing. Basically, speaking of this dimension is to assume as a team culture that brings out a specific style of play, that is, the creation of a dynamic collective identity that has individuals intents but related to the collective idea. Its little different to the theories Jos Mourinho used to espouse in the days when he still talked about football and weve heard similar from various Frade-inspired coaches. It explains why, when Wolves had a run of eight games in November and December when they scored two goals, Lage was relatively unruffled. For him, it was not as simple as the defence working and the attack being blunt; the whole was good and therefore the goals would come. Yet there had been a sense over the past couple of seasons that periodisation had had its day. It is a long time since Mourinho felt fresh. Nuno Esprito Santo went into decline at Wolves. Marco Silva disappointed at Everton. Carvalhal is at Braga. Leonardo Jardim has just left Al Hilal. Vtor Pereira, after being relegated with 1860 Munich, moved to China and, after being drummed out of Everton before he had been given the job, has just been named manager of Corinthians. Having won Euro 2016 with Portugal, the caution of Fernando Santos looks as though it may be restricting an emerging generation. It is not entirely clear whether Andr Villas-Boas is a resting football manager or a resting rally driver. But periodisation is a broad church: it describes a general method rather a specific style of play. There is no reason why a basic sense of the interconnectedness of things  which is certainly not unique to the Portuguese school  should necessarily result in the sort of stifling football that managers such as Mourinho, Santos and even Carlos Queiroz tend to produce. Lage spent a long time as an assistant at various smaller Portuguese clubs before eight years in the youth department at Benfica. After a stint in Dubai, he worked as Carvalhals assistant at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea. His experience is broad-based. In his season and a half as head coach at Benfica, his side were notably attacking, averaging 2.38 goals per game. Initially, he seemed to be attempting something similar at Wolves and the story of the early part of their season was of promising performances that didnt quite produce the results they deserved. Lage instituted a more reactive approach, more akin to how Wolves had played at their best under Nuno. Jos S has proved an upgrade on Rui Patrcio, while the emergence of Max Kilman has meant that, even in the absence of Willy Boly, the back three has been solid. Lage, who spent much of his career scouting opponents, had a video analysis room installed and the benefits of that have been seen in the more targeted pressing which yielded both goals against Tottenham (the free-kick that led to the first came from possession being won high) and the goal at Arsenal. Wolves have also become more conservative with the ball. No side in the Premier League crosses less often than Wolves; they had been sixth in that metric last season, albeit it many of them were delivered by Adama Traor, now on loan at Barcelona. They hold possession better, which increases the importance of Rben Neves. As Tottenham, having gone 2-0 down, showed in the final hour two weeks ago, if you shut him down you can disrupt Wolves but, more generally, that change has given Wolves more control and should make them less dependent on Ral Jimnez. Ideally, they need a little more creativity in that front three. Hwang Hee-chan has shown his promise and Pedro Neto is returning after 10 months out with a fractured patella, but Wolves might have hoped for a little more from Daniel Podence or Trinco. Only Burnley and Norwich have scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season, but there is reason to expect that to improve, at least to an extent, without major tactical changes. The dream of a top-four finish probably is now beginning to fade, but that can not reasonably be seen as failure. Wolves have the 14th-highest wage bill in the Premier League; they will comfortably outperform that this season. Lages tweaks, his version of periodisation, have led to distinct improvement.

But periodisation is a broad church: it describes a general method rather a specific style of play. There is no reason why a basic sense of the interconnectedness of things  which is certainly not unique to the Portuguese school  should necessarily result in the sort of stifling football that managers such as Mourinho, Santos and even Carlos Queiroz tend to produce. Lage spent a long time as an assistant at various smaller Portuguese clubs before eight years in the youth department at Benfica. After a stint in Dubai, he worked as Carvalhals assistant at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea. His experience is broad-based. In his season and a half as head coach at Benfica, his side were notably attacking, averaging 2.38 goals per game. Initially, he seemed to be attempting something similar at Wolves and the story of the early part of their season was of promising performances that didnt quite produce the results they deserved. Lage instituted a more reactive approach, more akin to how Wolves had played at their best under Nuno. Jos S has proved an upgrade on Rui Patrcio, while the emergence of Max Kilman has meant that, even in the absence of Willy Boly, the back three has been solid. Lage, who spent much of his career scouting opponents, had a video analysis room installed and the benefits of that have been seen in the more targeted pressing which yielded both goals against Tottenham (the free-kick that led to the first came from possession being won high) and the goal at Arsenal. Wolves have also become more conservative with the ball. No side in the Premier League crosses less often than Wolves; they had been sixth in that metric last season, albeit it many of them were delivered by Adama Traor, now on loan at Barcelona. They hold possession better, which increases the importance of Rben Neves. As Tottenham, having gone 2-0 down, showed in the final hour two weeks ago, if you shut him down you can disrupt Wolves but, more generally, that change has given Wolves more control and should make them less dependent on Ral Jimnez. Ideally, they need a little more creativity in that front three. Hwang Hee-chan has shown his promise and Pedro Neto is returning after 10 months out with a fractured patella, but Wolves might have hoped for a little more from Daniel Podence or Trinco. Only Burnley and Norwich have scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season, but there is reason to expect that to improve, at least to an extent, without major tactical changes. The dream of a top-four finish probably is now beginning to fade, but that can not reasonably be seen as failure. Wolves have the 14th-highest wage bill in the Premier League; they will comfortably outperform that this season. Lages tweaks, his version of periodisation, have led to distinct improvement.

The temptation when Bruno Lage was appointed by Wolves was to assume it would just be more of the same: another Portuguese manager, another Jorge Mendes client, at a club with a strong Portuguese core. If managers from the German school of hard-pressing are the most modish appointment for an aspirational modern club, Portugals disciples of Vtor Frade and periodisation are not far behind. While Lage is very much of that school  to the extent that in 2012, despite being a youth coach at Benfica at the time, he co-authored a report with the former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea coach Carlos Carvalhal on the latters implementation of periodisation at Besiktas  this has been a season of change at Wolves. The result is that, even after defeat at Arsenal on Thursday, Wolves go into Sundays game at West Ham with four more points than they have had at this stage of a Premier League season. Even if they do not finish in the top four, a club that had seemed to be stagnating have been reenergised and have a good chance of their best finish since coming fifth in 1972-73. Lages report on Besiktas, Soccer: Developing a Know-How, starts in the language familiar to anybody acquainted with Frades work, rejecting the reductionism of Cartesianism and those thinkers who having an object of study  separate its various components and attempt carefully to study each one with the goal of understanding each component better. In football, that means separating the game into four basic components: tactical, technical, physical and psychological. In Tactical Periodisation, the report explains, the understanding of the tactical is different  its a dimension that assumes the coordination of the whole process involving with it all other dimensions that assume equal importance. It demonstrates itself in a specific form depending on the choice of exercises so to model our style of playing. Basically, speaking of this dimension is to assume as a team culture that brings out a specific style of play, that is, the creation of a dynamic collective identity that has individuals intents but related to the collective idea. Its little different to the theories Jos Mourinho used to espouse in the days when he still talked about football and weve heard similar from various Frade-inspired coaches. It explains why, when Wolves had a run of eight games in November and December when they scored two goals, Lage was relatively unruffled. For him, it was not as simple as the defence working and the attack being blunt; the whole was good and therefore the goals would come. Yet there had been a sense over the past couple of seasons that periodisation had had its day. It is a long time since Mourinho felt fresh. Nuno Esprito Santo went into decline at Wolves. Marco Silva disappointed at Everton. Carvalhal is at Braga. Leonardo Jardim has just left Al Hilal. Vtor Pereira, after being relegated with 1860 Munich, moved to China and, after being drummed out of Everton before he had been given the job, has just been named manager of Corinthians.

The temptation when Bruno Lage was appointed by Wolves was to assume it would just be more of the same: another Portuguese manager, another Jorge Mendes client, at a club with a strong Portuguese core. If managers from the German school of hard-pressing are the most modish appointment for an aspirational modern club, Portugals disciples of Vtor Frade and periodisation are not far behind. While Lage is very much of that school  to the extent that in 2012, despite being a youth coach at Benfica at the time, he co-authored a report with the former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea coach Carlos Carvalhal on the latters implementation of periodisation at Besiktas  this has been a season of change at Wolves. The result is that, even after defeat at Arsenal on Thursday, Wolves go into Sundays game at West Ham with four more points than they have had at this stage of a Premier League season. Even if they do not finish in the top four, a club that had seemed to be stagnating have been reenergised and have a good chance of their best finish since coming fifth in 1972-73. Lages report on Besiktas, Soccer: Developing a Know-How, starts in the language familiar to anybody acquainted with Frades work, rejecting the reductionism of Cartesianism and those thinkers who having an object of study  separate its various components and attempt carefully to study each one with the goal of understanding each component better. In football, that means separating the game into four basic components: tactical, technical, physical and psychological. In Tactical Periodisation, the report explains, the understanding of the tactical is different  its a dimension that assumes the coordination of the whole process involving with it all other dimensions that assume equal importance. It demonstrates itself in a specific form depending on the choice of exercises so to model our style of playing. Basically, speaking of this dimension is to assume as a team culture that brings out a specific style of play, that is, the creation of a dynamic collective identity that has individuals intents but related to the collective idea. Its little different to the theories Jos Mourinho used to espouse in the days when he still talked about football and weve heard similar from various Frade-inspired coaches. It explains why, when Wolves had a run of eight games in November and December when they scored two goals, Lage was relatively unruffled. For him, it was not as simple as the defence working and the attack being blunt; the whole was good and therefore the goals would come. Yet there had been a sense over the past couple of seasons that periodisation had had its day. It is a long time since Mourinho felt fresh. Nuno Esprito Santo went into decline at Wolves. Marco Silva disappointed at Everton. Carvalhal is at Braga. Leonardo Jardim has just left Al Hilal. Vtor Pereira, after being relegated with 1860 Munich, moved to China and, after being drummed out of Everton before he had been given the job, has just been named manager of Corinthians. Having won Euro 2016 with Portugal, the caution of Fernando Santos looks as though it may be restricting an emerging generation. It is not entirely clear whether Andr Villas-Boas is a resting football manager or a resting rally driver. But periodisation is a broad church: it describes a general method rather a specific style of play. There is no reason why a basic sense of the interconnectedness of things  which is certainly not unique to the Portuguese school  should necessarily result in the sort of stifling football that managers such as Mourinho, Santos and even Carlos Queiroz tend to produce. Lage spent a long time as an assistant at various smaller Portuguese clubs before eight years in the youth department at Benfica. After a stint in Dubai, he worked as Carvalhals assistant at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea. His experience is broad-based. In his season and a half as head coach at Benfica, his side were notably attacking, averaging 2.38 goals per game. Initially, he seemed to be attempting something similar at Wolves and the story of the early part of their season was of promising performances that didnt quite produce the results they deserved. Lage instituted a more reactive approach, more akin to how Wolves had played at their best under Nuno. Jos S has proved an upgrade on Rui Patrcio, while the emergence of Max Kilman has meant that, even in the absence of Willy Boly, the back three has been solid. Lage, who spent much of his career scouting opponents, had a video analysis room installed and the benefits of that have been seen in the more targeted pressing which yielded both goals against Tottenham (the free-kick that led to the first came from possession being won high) and the goal at Arsenal. Wolves have also become more conservative with the ball. No side in the Premier League crosses less often than Wolves; they had been sixth in that metric last season, albeit it many of them were delivered by Adama Traor, now on loan at Barcelona. They hold possession better, which increases the importance of Rben Neves. As Tottenham, having gone 2-0 down, showed in the final hour two weeks ago, if you shut him down you can disrupt Wolves but, more generally, that change has given Wolves more control and should make them less dependent on Ral Jimnez. Ideally, they need a little more creativity in that front three. Hwang Hee-chan has shown his promise and Pedro Neto is returning after 10 months out with a fractured patella, but Wolves might have hoped for a little more from Daniel Podence or Trinco. Only Burnley and Norwich have scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season, but there is reason to expect that to improve, at least to an extent, without major tactical changes. The dream of a top-four finish probably is now beginning to fade, but that can not reasonably be seen as failure. Wolves have the 14th-highest wage bill in the Premier League; they will comfortably outperform that this season. Lages tweaks, his version of periodisation, have led to distinct improvement.

Gabriel Jesus has refused to commit his future to Manchester City beyond this season, with the forward having a year on his terms from July. The 25-year-old scored four goals in the 5-1 home defeat of Watford on Saturday but suggested he may depart, having joined in August 2016. Pep Guardiola wants to sign a centre-forward in the summer, with Borussia Dortmunds Erling Haaland his No 1 target. Jesus was asked whether he would like to stay and fight for a place if a striker is signed. Its not time to think about this, he said. You expect me to say this, but its true. This is no time to think about this. Now is the best moment of the season. I want to enjoy, to keep focused on my team, with my teammates, to fight for the Premier League. I won it with my teammates three times. And I know how that feels and I want to have that feeling again. And then of course we also have the tough game on Tuesday against Real Madrid [in the Champions League] and that is my focus. Jesus, asked whether he would like to start more regularly, said: Its not just me, its [all] the players. If you ask, everyones going to say I want to play and the season that I arrived here I played a lot, I think. I know what I expect of course but I know we have very good players who can play every game as well and sometimes its not just me, its Riyad [Mahrez], sometimes Raz [Sterling], and [Jack] Grealish arrives this season and sees how it is here. We have a lot of good strikers, wingers and forwards. Jesus arrived as a central striker but now operates mostly on the right wing. He was asked his best position. A street player, the Brazilian said. Like you go there and play up front, run everywhere and then try to fight to regain the ball to attack, to do the actions quickly. I think this is my quality.

Jarrad Branthwaite and Salomn Rondn were sent off and the manager was left upset by his side not being given a penalty in the buildup to the first dismissal, when the home side were 1-0 up. Richarlison was having his shirt pulled by Mads Bech Srensen in the area but Michael Oliver did not award a penalty, allowing Brentford to clear the ball up the pitch, where Branthwaite pulled down Ivan Toney to earn his first-half red. I thought it was a penalty, Lampard said. Its a shirt pull, a clear shirt pull, its a foul in the box. If youre asking Richarlison to go down then youre asking people to fall on the floor. My players have been criticised, when they shouldnt have been, for going down for fouls that are fouls. I think that was a penalty. I cant complain about the red after that. If they dont give that [the penalty] then its a red card. The reality is were on the bad end of a lot of decisions this season. Thats hard because I have to represent the club and the fans that come here and those small margins can affect our position. I do believe if its a penalty on the shirt pull means 2-0 and 11 men, and I think we all know how that game goes. Srensen did give away a penalty for a pull on Richarlison before half-time but the defender was not given a second yellow card, which Lampard believes would have been deserved. Rondn will be unavailable for Evertons crucial final two games against Crystal Palace and Arsenal and Branthwaite for the first of those, a further blow to Lampard. Rondn was sent off for a two-footed lunge on Rico Henry four minutes after coming off the bench. Salomns is a bad tackle, I think you see in his reaction then he comes off. Its a hot-headed reaction. Its not the Salomn I know.

Grenada is playing host to an absorbing series decider between West Indies and England, if not always by way of quality out in the middle then certainly in terms of injecting some much needed Caribbean soul into proceedings. The steel drummers have been wonderfully relentless and the locals have already turned up in good numbers for what is the islands first Test match in seven years; the arrival of the weekend promises a further rise here, so too a match situation which, after two topsy-turvy days, appears on a knife edge. Those who are drawn to the National Cricket Stadium in St Georges first thing will see West Indies resume on 232 for eight, with a lead of 28 over their visitors. It follows three hard-fought sessions of cricket that, like the previous day, saw a top-order collapse offset by a feisty rearguard down the order. Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six  109 runs behind  and changing the complexion of the day. Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, Englands attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring  some 16 decisions have been overturned  when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End  named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages  and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home. At the other end Overton followed the approach amid a fiery battle with John Campbell. The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overtons innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in Englands 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overtons innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in Englands 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

Grenada is playing host to an absorbing series decider between West Indies and England, if not always by way of quality out in the middle then certainly in terms of injecting some much needed Caribbean soul into proceedings. The steel drummers have been wonderfully relentless and the locals have already turned up in good numbers for what is the islands first Test match in seven years; the arrival of the weekend promises a further rise here, so too a match situation which, after two topsy-turvy days, appears on a knife edge. Those who are drawn to the National Cricket Stadium in St Georges first thing will see West Indies resume on 232 for eight, with a lead of 28 over their visitors. It follows three hard-fought sessions of cricket that, like the previous day, saw a top-order collapse offset by a feisty rearguard down the order. Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six  109 runs behind  and changing the complexion of the day. Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, Englands attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring  some 16 decisions have been overturned  when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End  named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages  and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home.

Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

Grenada is playing host to an absorbing series decider between West Indies and England, if not always by way of quality out in the middle then certainly in terms of injecting some much needed Caribbean soul into proceedings. The steel drummers have been wonderfully relentless and the locals have already turned up in good numbers for what is the islands first Test match in seven years; the arrival of the weekend promises a further rise here, so too a match situation which, after two topsy-turvy days, appears on a knife edge. Those who are drawn to the National Cricket Stadium in St Georges first thing will see West Indies resume on 232 for eight, with a lead of 28 over their visitors. It follows three hard-fought sessions of cricket that, like the previous day, saw a top-order collapse offset by a feisty rearguard down the order. Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six  109 runs behind  and changing the complexion of the day. Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, Englands attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring  some 16 decisions have been overturned  when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End  named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages  and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home. At the other end Overton followed the approach amid a fiery battle with John Campbell. The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overtons innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in Englands 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

My friend Steve Neale, who has died aged 71, was a film historian and a well-known figure in the development of film studies in UK universities. Steve began teaching and writing at an opportune moment in the 1970s, when film studies was being established as a discipline in the humanities, and his work helped to shape how the subject was and is taught in the UK. Steve wrote about a wide variety of topics, from film technology to gender representation, politics and film and the history of Hollywood. He is best known for his work on popular film genres, including two books, Genre (1980) and Genre and Hollywood (2000). He was born in Bexleyheath, Kent, to Doreen (nee Molkenthin), who served in the Womens Royal Naval Service during the second world war, and Ronald Neale, a sales manager at a small engineering firm. From Chislehurst and Sidcup grammar school he went on to study English literature at the University of Exeter, graduating in 1972. After teacher training at Whitelands College (now part of the University of Roehampton), he taught English and film studies at the Little Ilford school in Newham, London (1973-75) before joining the British Film Institute in 1976 as a lecturer. He then moved to the Arnolfini arts centre in Bristol, selecting films for public exhibition (1979-80), and to the Midland Group arts centre in Nottingham (1980-84). Steve taught film studies at the University of Kent (1984-97), and in 1996 moved to Sheffield Hallam University, where he was senior lecturer in film studies. In 1997 he became research professor in film, media and communication studies. He joined the University of Exeter as professor and chair in film studies in 2004 and I met him three years later when he became my PhD supervisor. He was a friendly and unassuming man  on meeting him for the first time, few would guess that he was one of the greatest scholars of motion pictures. He retired in 2014. A collection of his work was published earlier this year in a book, Film, Cinema, Genre: The Steve Neale Reader, edited by Frank Krutnik and Richard Maltby. It attests to the sustained importance of Steves work over more than 40 years. In retirement, Steve remained in Exeter and continued researching and writing about film. He met Karen Edwards in 2004 when she was a lecturer in English at Exeter University. They married in 2016. He is survived by Karen, by his brother, David, his nephew, David, and his great-nieces, Lola and Robyn.

My friend Steve Neale, who has died aged 71, was a film historian and a well-known figure in the development of film studies in UK universities. Steve began teaching and writing at an opportune moment in the 1970s, when film studies was being established as a discipline in the humanities, and his work helped to shape how the subject was and is taught in the UK. Steve wrote about a wide variety of topics, from film technology to gender representation, politics and film and the history of Hollywood. He is best known for his work on popular film genres, including two books, Genre (1980) and Genre and Hollywood (2000). He was born in Bexleyheath, Kent, to Doreen (nee Molkenthin), who served in the Womens Royal Naval Service during the second world war, and Ronald Neale, a sales manager at a small engineering firm. From Chislehurst and Sidcup grammar school he went on to study English literature at the University of Exeter, graduating in 1972. After teacher training at Whitelands College (now part of the University of Roehampton), he taught English and film studies at the Little Ilford school in Newham, London (1973-75) before joining the British Film Institute in 1976 as a lecturer. He then moved to the Arnolfini arts centre in Bristol, selecting films for public exhibition (1979-80), and to the Midland Group arts centre in Nottingham (1980-84). Steve taught film studies at the University of Kent (1984-97), and in 1996 moved to Sheffield Hallam University, where he was senior lecturer in film studies. In 1997 he became research professor in film, media and communication studies. He joined the University of Exeter as professor and chair in film studies in 2004 and I met him three years later when he became my PhD supervisor. He was a friendly and unassuming man  on meeting him for the first time, few would guess that he was one of the greatest scholars of motion pictures. He retired in 2014.

My friend Steve Neale, who has died aged 71, was a film historian and a well-known figure in the development of film studies in UK universities. Steve began teaching and writing at an opportune moment in the 1970s, when film studies was being established as a discipline in the humanities, and his work helped to shape how the subject was and is taught in the UK. Steve wrote about a wide variety of topics, from film technology to gender representation, politics and film and the history of Hollywood. He is best known for his work on popular film genres, including two books, Genre (1980) and Genre and Hollywood (2000). He was born in Bexleyheath, Kent, to Doreen (nee Molkenthin), who served in the Womens Royal Naval Service during the second world war, and Ronald Neale, a sales manager at a small engineering firm. From Chislehurst and Sidcup grammar school he went on to study English literature at the University of Exeter, graduating in 1972. After teacher training at Whitelands College (now part of the University of Roehampton), he taught English and film studies at the Little Ilford school in Newham, London (1973-75) before joining the British Film Institute in 1976 as a lecturer. He then moved to the Arnolfini arts centre in Bristol, selecting films for public exhibition (1979-80), and to the Midland Group arts centre in Nottingham (1980-84). Steve taught film studies at the University of Kent (1984-97), and in 1996 moved to Sheffield Hallam University, where he was senior lecturer in film studies. In 1997 he became research professor in film, media and communication studies. He joined the University of Exeter as professor and chair in film studies in 2004 and I met him three years later when he became my PhD supervisor. He was a friendly and unassuming man  on meeting him for the first time, few would guess that he was one of the greatest scholars of motion pictures. He retired in 2014. A collection of his work was published earlier this year in a book, Film, Cinema, Genre: The Steve Neale Reader, edited by Frank Krutnik and Richard Maltby. It attests to the sustained importance of Steves work over more than 40 years. In retirement, Steve remained in Exeter and continued researching and writing about film. He met Karen Edwards in 2004 when she was a lecturer in English at Exeter University. They married in 2016. He is survived by Karen, by his brother, David, his nephew, David, and his great-nieces, Lola and Robyn.

Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernndez has been arrested, a day after the US Department of Justice requested his extradition over drug trafficking and weapons charges, culminating a spectacular fall from grace for a man who was once considered one of Washingtons top allies in Central America. On Tuesday afternoon Hernndez left his home in a wealthy neighborhood in the countrys capital, Tegucigalpa, where he was cuffed at the hands and feet and provided a bullet-proof vest before being taken away in a police caravan to a special forces base. He will appear before a judge for his first hearing within 24 hours. According to the extradition request submitted to Honduras, Hernndez was part of a violent drug-trafficking conspiracy that trafficked roughly 500,000 kilos of cocaine since 2004. The long-rumored indictment comes just over two weeks after Hernndez, 53, left office and strikes a critical blow to the reputation of a former president who had been praised early in his presidency by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his governments efforts to extradite drug traffickers. About 100 police officers had surrounded Hernndezs home late on Monday, pending the decision by the supreme court to issue an arrest warrant. Hernndez has previously described the allegations against him as lies made up by violent drug traffickers who are seeking revenge and to reduce their sentences. They found the magic key to go unpunished, surrender and negotiate and accuse the institutions for putting them behind bars, said Hernndez in a February 2021 address. He has also pointed to a constitutional reform allowing Hondurans to be extradited to the US  passed while president of Congress in 2012  as evidence of his innocence. A person who has colluded with drug traffickers would never approve extradition, he said. But evidence presented by US prosecutors in recent trials of Honduran drug traffickers suggests that Hernndez believed he could control who was extradited and therefore avoid repercussions for him and close allies. Formal accusations of Hernndezs alleged involvement in drug trafficking first came to light in August 2019 when he was named in a court filing as a co-conspirator of his brother Juan Antonio Tony Hernndez, who was arrested while visiting the United States. During the subsequent trial, prosecutors accused the brothers of overseeing a scheme that they described as state-sponsored drug trafficking. Tony Hernndez was convicted on drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. He was sentenced last year to life in prison. In April 2020, Hernndez was named again as a co-conspirator when US prosecutors indicted former national police chief Juan Carlos El Tigre Bonilla Valladares with drug trafficking and related weapons charges. According to the indictment, Hernndez entrusted Bonilla with special assignments, including murder. In a third case less than a year later, a court heard that Hernndez had allegedly plotted with another Honduran drug trafficker, Geovanny Fuentes, to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos. Fuentes was convicted of drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. His sentencing is scheduled for February. Bucking tradition, Hernndez did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Xiomara Castro, on 27 January  the same day that an arrest warrant was issued in the United States. Hernndez began his political career in 1998 when he won a seat in congress to represent his home department of Lempira  located within a key drug trafficking corridor in western Honduras. In 2010, he became president of congress and then four years later, president of the republic. According to prosecutors, his rise in politics is owed in part to millions in bribes from drug traffickers. The drug trafficking conspiracy charge carries a sentence of 10 years to life.

Bucking tradition, Hernndez did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Xiomara Castro, on 27 January  the same day that an arrest warrant was issued in the United States. Hernndez began his political career in 1998 when he won a seat in congress to represent his home department of Lempira  located within a key drug trafficking corridor in western Honduras. In 2010, he became president of congress and then four years later, president of the republic. According to prosecutors, his rise in politics is owed in part to millions in bribes from drug traffickers. The drug trafficking conspiracy charge carries a sentence of 10 years to life.

Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernndez has been arrested, a day after the US Department of Justice requested his extradition over drug trafficking and weapons charges, culminating a spectacular fall from grace for a man who was once considered one of Washingtons top allies in Central America. On Tuesday afternoon Hernndez left his home in a wealthy neighborhood in the countrys capital, Tegucigalpa, where he was cuffed at the hands and feet and provided a bullet-proof vest before being taken away in a police caravan to a special forces base. He will appear before a judge for his first hearing within 24 hours. According to the extradition request submitted to Honduras, Hernndez was part of a violent drug-trafficking conspiracy that trafficked roughly 500,000 kilos of cocaine since 2004. The long-rumored indictment comes just over two weeks after Hernndez, 53, left office and strikes a critical blow to the reputation of a former president who had been praised early in his presidency by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his governments efforts to extradite drug traffickers. About 100 police officers had surrounded Hernndezs home late on Monday, pending the decision by the supreme court to issue an arrest warrant. Hernndez has previously described the allegations against him as lies made up by violent drug traffickers who are seeking revenge and to reduce their sentences. They found the magic key to go unpunished, surrender and negotiate and accuse the institutions for putting them behind bars, said Hernndez in a February 2021 address. He has also pointed to a constitutional reform allowing Hondurans to be extradited to the US  passed while president of Congress in 2012  as evidence of his innocence. A person who has colluded with drug traffickers would never approve extradition, he said. But evidence presented by US prosecutors in recent trials of Honduran drug traffickers suggests that Hernndez believed he could control who was extradited and therefore avoid repercussions for him and close allies. Formal accusations of Hernndezs alleged involvement in drug trafficking first came to light in August 2019 when he was named in a court filing as a co-conspirator of his brother Juan Antonio Tony Hernndez, who was arrested while visiting the United States. During the subsequent trial, prosecutors accused the brothers of overseeing a scheme that they described as state-sponsored drug trafficking. Tony Hernndez was convicted on drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. He was sentenced last year to life in prison. In April 2020, Hernndez was named again as a co-conspirator when US prosecutors indicted former national police chief Juan Carlos El Tigre Bonilla Valladares with drug trafficking and related weapons charges. According to the indictment, Hernndez entrusted Bonilla with special assignments, including murder. In a third case less than a year later, a court heard that Hernndez had allegedly plotted with another Honduran drug trafficker, Geovanny Fuentes, to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos. Fuentes was convicted of drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. His sentencing is scheduled for February.

In 2010, he became president of congress and then four years later, president of the republic. According to prosecutors, his rise in politics is owed in part to millions in bribes from drug traffickers. The drug trafficking conspiracy charge carries a sentence of 10 years to life.

Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernndez has been arrested, a day after the US Department of Justice requested his extradition over drug trafficking and weapons charges, culminating a spectacular fall from grace for a man who was once considered one of Washingtons top allies in Central America. On Tuesday afternoon Hernndez left his home in a wealthy neighborhood in the countrys capital, Tegucigalpa, where he was cuffed at the hands and feet and provided a bullet-proof vest before being taken away in a police caravan to a special forces base. He will appear before a judge for his first hearing within 24 hours. According to the extradition request submitted to Honduras, Hernndez was part of a violent drug-trafficking conspiracy that trafficked roughly 500,000 kilos of cocaine since 2004. The long-rumored indictment comes just over two weeks after Hernndez, 53, left office and strikes a critical blow to the reputation of a former president who had been praised early in his presidency by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his governments efforts to extradite drug traffickers. About 100 police officers had surrounded Hernndezs home late on Monday, pending the decision by the supreme court to issue an arrest warrant. Hernndez has previously described the allegations against him as lies made up by violent drug traffickers who are seeking revenge and to reduce their sentences. They found the magic key to go unpunished, surrender and negotiate and accuse the institutions for putting them behind bars, said Hernndez in a February 2021 address. He has also pointed to a constitutional reform allowing Hondurans to be extradited to the US  passed while president of Congress in 2012  as evidence of his innocence. A person who has colluded with drug traffickers would never approve extradition, he said. But evidence presented by US prosecutors in recent trials of Honduran drug traffickers suggests that Hernndez believed he could control who was extradited and therefore avoid repercussions for him and close allies. Formal accusations of Hernndezs alleged involvement in drug trafficking first came to light in August 2019 when he was named in a court filing as a co-conspirator of his brother Juan Antonio Tony Hernndez, who was arrested while visiting the United States. During the subsequent trial, prosecutors accused the brothers of overseeing a scheme that they described as state-sponsored drug trafficking. Tony Hernndez was convicted on drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. He was sentenced last year to life in prison. In April 2020, Hernndez was named again as a co-conspirator when US prosecutors indicted former national police chief Juan Carlos El Tigre Bonilla Valladares with drug trafficking and related weapons charges. According to the indictment, Hernndez entrusted Bonilla with special assignments, including murder. In a third case less than a year later, a court heard that Hernndez had allegedly plotted with another Honduran drug trafficker, Geovanny Fuentes, to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos. Fuentes was convicted of drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. His sentencing is scheduled for February. Bucking tradition, Hernndez did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Xiomara Castro, on 27 January  the same day that an arrest warrant was issued in the United States.

I dont like the idea of good food being intimidating, says Eun Hee An. True to this approach, An tells me her chosen breakfast of tarak-juk  a rice porridge, or congee, made with one part milk and two parts dashi, or stock  is so simple. Topped with crabmeat, ginger and spring onion, the dish is at once satisfyingly savoury and light, especially when served with white kimchi as An suggests. And if crab seems like a big ask for a simple dish, An says you can use any type of crab, cooked or raw, leftover or fresh or pre-packed  anything you can easily get. Making congee with milk is far from a new idea; in fact, it dates back a number of centuries. Originally, tarak-juk is a dish from the royal courts of Joseon-era Korea which brings together milk, ground glutinous rice and honey or sugar to make a smooth, sweet, delicate porridge. Its the only traditional Korean dish that has milk, she says. There was one herd of dairy cattle kept for the royal court and the physicians would make tarak-juk for the king. So its kings congee, which seems pretty special. While her recipe is nothing like tarak-juk you get in Korea, An says it is the combination of rice and milk that is so comforting. When we were writing a menu for [restaurant] Moon Park, my weird boyfriend [Ben Sears] kept asking me about it. We made it and it was surprisingly great. Ans culinary career began when she moved to Australia to study French cooking. Once, she says, she never would have imagined making Korean food for a living. Over time, however, she found herself drawn back to the cuisine of her childhood. I grew up cooking with my grannies ... I guess the longer youre away from it the more you grow to appreciate it. An previously ran Moon Park in Redfern and Paper Bird in Potts Point alongside Sears. After Paper Bird closed, she launched Moon Mart, an online shop selling a range of Asian condiments, pickles and snacks, in November of last year. Everything, from staple items such as kimchi to vegan XO sauce and products with limited runs, is made by An in a bakery after hours. Her more experimental products have included different kinds of cheong (fruit preserved in sugar, with a jam-like consistency) or blood orange kosho, a fermented chilli condiment. Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice. As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: I think maybe my family is there. I havent seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic. And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he cant eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion! Eun Hee Ans tarak-juk with crab Prep 15 min Cook 35-40 min Serves 2 1  cup cooked short-grain rice 2 cups whole milk (500ml) 4 cups dashi or light chicken stock, or 4 cups water plus 70ml shirodashi (a seasoning and soup stock concentrate available at Korean or Japanese grocers) White soy sauce or extra shirodashi to season Ground white pepper 120g crabmeat 1 spring onion, finely sliced 3-4 thin slices of ginger, finely julienned White kimchi (a type of mild kimchi made without chilli, available at Korean or Japanese grocers  or Moon Mart) Put the cooked rice, milk and dashi in a 20cm saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring to break up any rice that is stuck together, if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan. The tarak-juk should have a thick, porridge-like consistency. Season the tarak-juk to taste with ground white pepper (a little goes a long way) and a little extra shirodashi, if needed. Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side. Note: If you would like to make dashi from scratch: soak a 12cm piece of kombu in five cups of water overnight, then in the morning, bring kombu and water just to a boil over medium heat. Remove the kombu from the pan and add one cup, or roughly 10g of bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Allow bonito flakes to steep for 10 minutes, then strain.

True to this approach, An tells me her chosen breakfast of tarak-juk  a rice porridge, or congee, made with one part milk and two parts dashi, or stock  is so simple. Topped with crabmeat, ginger and spring onion, the dish is at once satisfyingly savoury and light, especially when served with white kimchi as An suggests. And if crab seems like a big ask for a simple dish, An says you can use any type of crab, cooked or raw, leftover or fresh or pre-packed  anything you can easily get. Making congee with milk is far from a new idea; in fact, it dates back a number of centuries. Originally, tarak-juk is a dish from the royal courts of Joseon-era Korea which brings together milk, ground glutinous rice and honey or sugar to make a smooth, sweet, delicate porridge. Its the only traditional Korean dish that has milk, she says. There was one herd of dairy cattle kept for the royal court and the physicians would make tarak-juk for the king. So its kings congee, which seems pretty special. While her recipe is nothing like tarak-juk you get in Korea, An says it is the combination of rice and milk that is so comforting. When we were writing a menu for [restaurant] Moon Park, my weird boyfriend [Ben Sears] kept asking me about it. We made it and it was surprisingly great. Ans culinary career began when she moved to Australia to study French cooking. Once, she says, she never would have imagined making Korean food for a living. Over time, however, she found herself drawn back to the cuisine of her childhood. I grew up cooking with my grannies ... I guess the longer youre away from it the more you grow to appreciate it. An previously ran Moon Park in Redfern and Paper Bird in Potts Point alongside Sears. After Paper Bird closed, she launched Moon Mart, an online shop selling a range of Asian condiments, pickles and snacks, in November of last year. Everything, from staple items such as kimchi to vegan XO sauce and products with limited runs, is made by An in a bakery after hours. Her more experimental products have included different kinds of cheong (fruit preserved in sugar, with a jam-like consistency) or blood orange kosho, a fermented chilli condiment. Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice. As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: I think maybe my family is there. I havent seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic. And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he cant eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion! Eun Hee Ans tarak-juk with crab Prep 15 min Cook 35-40 min Serves 2 1  cup cooked short-grain rice 2 cups whole milk (500ml) 4 cups dashi or light chicken stock, or 4 cups water plus 70ml shirodashi (a seasoning and soup stock concentrate available at Korean or Japanese grocers) White soy sauce or extra shirodashi to season Ground white pepper 120g crabmeat 1 spring onion, finely sliced 3-4 thin slices of ginger, finely julienned White kimchi (a type of mild kimchi made without chilli, available at Korean or Japanese grocers  or Moon Mart) Put the cooked rice, milk and dashi in a 20cm saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring to break up any rice that is stuck together, if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan. The tarak-juk should have a thick, porridge-like consistency. Season the tarak-juk to taste with ground white pepper (a little goes a long way) and a little extra shirodashi, if needed. Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side. Note: If you would like to make dashi from scratch: soak a 12cm piece of kombu in five cups of water overnight, then in the morning, bring kombu and water just to a boil over medium heat. Remove the kombu from the pan and add one cup, or roughly 10g of bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Allow bonito flakes to steep for 10 minutes, then strain.

Everything, from staple items such as kimchi to vegan XO sauce and products with limited runs, is made by An in a bakery after hours. Her more experimental products have included different kinds of cheong (fruit preserved in sugar, with a jam-like consistency) or blood orange kosho, a fermented chilli condiment. Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice. As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: I think maybe my family is there. I havent seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic. And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he cant eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion! Eun Hee Ans tarak-juk with crab Prep 15 min Cook 35-40 min Serves 2 1  cup cooked short-grain rice 2 cups whole milk (500ml) 4 cups dashi or light chicken stock, or 4 cups water plus 70ml shirodashi (a seasoning and soup stock concentrate available at Korean or Japanese grocers) White soy sauce or extra shirodashi to season Ground white pepper 120g crabmeat 1 spring onion, finely sliced 3-4 thin slices of ginger, finely julienned White kimchi (a type of mild kimchi made without chilli, available at Korean or Japanese grocers  or Moon Mart) Put the cooked rice, milk and dashi in a 20cm saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring to break up any rice that is stuck together, if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan. The tarak-juk should have a thick, porridge-like consistency. Season the tarak-juk to taste with ground white pepper (a little goes a long way) and a little extra shirodashi, if needed. Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side. Note: If you would like to make dashi from scratch: soak a 12cm piece of kombu in five cups of water overnight, then in the morning, bring kombu and water just to a boil over medium heat. Remove the kombu from the pan and add one cup, or roughly 10g of bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Allow bonito flakes to steep for 10 minutes, then strain.

I dont like the idea of good food being intimidating, says Eun Hee An. True to this approach, An tells me her chosen breakfast of tarak-juk  a rice porridge, or congee, made with one part milk and two parts dashi, or stock  is so simple. Topped with crabmeat, ginger and spring onion, the dish is at once satisfyingly savoury and light, especially when served with white kimchi as An suggests. And if crab seems like a big ask for a simple dish, An says you can use any type of crab, cooked or raw, leftover or fresh or pre-packed  anything you can easily get. Making congee with milk is far from a new idea; in fact, it dates back a number of centuries. Originally, tarak-juk is a dish from the royal courts of Joseon-era Korea which brings together milk, ground glutinous rice and honey or sugar to make a smooth, sweet, delicate porridge. Its the only traditional Korean dish that has milk, she says. There was one herd of dairy cattle kept for the royal court and the physicians would make tarak-juk for the king. So its kings congee, which seems pretty special. While her recipe is nothing like tarak-juk you get in Korea, An says it is the combination of rice and milk that is so comforting. When we were writing a menu for [restaurant] Moon Park, my weird boyfriend [Ben Sears] kept asking me about it. We made it and it was surprisingly great. Ans culinary career began when she moved to Australia to study French cooking. Once, she says, she never would have imagined making Korean food for a living. Over time, however, she found herself drawn back to the cuisine of her childhood. I grew up cooking with my grannies ... I guess the longer youre away from it the more you grow to appreciate it.

Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side. Note: If you would like to make dashi from scratch: soak a 12cm piece of kombu in five cups of water overnight, then in the morning, bring kombu and water just to a boil over medium heat. Remove the kombu from the pan and add one cup, or roughly 10g of bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Allow bonito flakes to steep for 10 minutes, then strain.

I dont like the idea of good food being intimidating, says Eun Hee An. True to this approach, An tells me her chosen breakfast of tarak-juk  a rice porridge, or congee, made with one part milk and two parts dashi, or stock  is so simple. Topped with crabmeat, ginger and spring onion, the dish is at once satisfyingly savoury and light, especially when served with white kimchi as An suggests. And if crab seems like a big ask for a simple dish, An says you can use any type of crab, cooked or raw, leftover or fresh or pre-packed  anything you can easily get. Making congee with milk is far from a new idea; in fact, it dates back a number of centuries. Originally, tarak-juk is a dish from the royal courts of Joseon-era Korea which brings together milk, ground glutinous rice and honey or sugar to make a smooth, sweet, delicate porridge. Its the only traditional Korean dish that has milk, she says. There was one herd of dairy cattle kept for the royal court and the physicians would make tarak-juk for the king. So its kings congee, which seems pretty special. While her recipe is nothing like tarak-juk you get in Korea, An says it is the combination of rice and milk that is so comforting. When we were writing a menu for [restaurant] Moon Park, my weird boyfriend [Ben Sears] kept asking me about it. We made it and it was surprisingly great. Ans culinary career began when she moved to Australia to study French cooking. Once, she says, she never would have imagined making Korean food for a living. Over time, however, she found herself drawn back to the cuisine of her childhood. I grew up cooking with my grannies ... I guess the longer youre away from it the more you grow to appreciate it. An previously ran Moon Park in Redfern and Paper Bird in Potts Point alongside Sears. After Paper Bird closed, she launched Moon Mart, an online shop selling a range of Asian condiments, pickles and snacks, in November of last year. Everything, from staple items such as kimchi to vegan XO sauce and products with limited runs, is made by An in a bakery after hours. Her more experimental products have included different kinds of cheong (fruit preserved in sugar, with a jam-like consistency) or blood orange kosho, a fermented chilli condiment. Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice. As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: I think maybe my family is there. I havent seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic. And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he cant eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion!

Topped with crabmeat, ginger and spring onion, the dish is at once satisfyingly savoury and light, especially when served with white kimchi as An suggests. And if crab seems like a big ask for a simple dish, An says you can use any type of crab, cooked or raw, leftover or fresh or pre-packed  anything you can easily get. Making congee with milk is far from a new idea; in fact, it dates back a number of centuries. Originally, tarak-juk is a dish from the royal courts of Joseon-era Korea which brings together milk, ground glutinous rice and honey or sugar to make a smooth, sweet, delicate porridge. Its the only traditional Korean dish that has milk, she says. There was one herd of dairy cattle kept for the royal court and the physicians would make tarak-juk for the king. So its kings congee, which seems pretty special. While her recipe is nothing like tarak-juk you get in Korea, An says it is the combination of rice and milk that is so comforting. When we were writing a menu for [restaurant] Moon Park, my weird boyfriend [Ben Sears] kept asking me about it. We made it and it was surprisingly great. Ans culinary career began when she moved to Australia to study French cooking. Once, she says, she never would have imagined making Korean food for a living. Over time, however, she found herself drawn back to the cuisine of her childhood. I grew up cooking with my grannies ... I guess the longer youre away from it the more you grow to appreciate it. An previously ran Moon Park in Redfern and Paper Bird in Potts Point alongside Sears. After Paper Bird closed, she launched Moon Mart, an online shop selling a range of Asian condiments, pickles and snacks, in November of last year. Everything, from staple items such as kimchi to vegan XO sauce and products with limited runs, is made by An in a bakery after hours. Her more experimental products have included different kinds of cheong (fruit preserved in sugar, with a jam-like consistency) or blood orange kosho, a fermented chilli condiment. Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice. As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: I think maybe my family is there. I havent seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic. And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he cant eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion! Eun Hee Ans tarak-juk with crab Prep 15 min Cook 35-40 min Serves 2 1  cup cooked short-grain rice 2 cups whole milk (500ml) 4 cups dashi or light chicken stock, or 4 cups water plus 70ml shirodashi (a seasoning and soup stock concentrate available at Korean or Japanese grocers) White soy sauce or extra shirodashi to season Ground white pepper 120g crabmeat 1 spring onion, finely sliced 3-4 thin slices of ginger, finely julienned White kimchi (a type of mild kimchi made without chilli, available at Korean or Japanese grocers  or Moon Mart) Put the cooked rice, milk and dashi in a 20cm saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring to break up any rice that is stuck together, if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan. The tarak-juk should have a thick, porridge-like consistency. Season the tarak-juk to taste with ground white pepper (a little goes a long way) and a little extra shirodashi, if needed. Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side. Note: If you would like to make dashi from scratch: soak a 12cm piece of kombu in five cups of water overnight, then in the morning, bring kombu and water just to a boil over medium heat. Remove the kombu from the pan and add one cup, or roughly 10g of bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Allow bonito flakes to steep for 10 minutes, then strain.

Her more experimental products have included different kinds of cheong (fruit preserved in sugar, with a jam-like consistency) or blood orange kosho, a fermented chilli condiment. Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice. As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: I think maybe my family is there. I havent seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic. And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he cant eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion! Eun Hee Ans tarak-juk with crab Prep 15 min Cook 35-40 min Serves 2 1  cup cooked short-grain rice 2 cups whole milk (500ml) 4 cups dashi or light chicken stock, or 4 cups water plus 70ml shirodashi (a seasoning and soup stock concentrate available at Korean or Japanese grocers) White soy sauce or extra shirodashi to season Ground white pepper 120g crabmeat 1 spring onion, finely sliced 3-4 thin slices of ginger, finely julienned White kimchi (a type of mild kimchi made without chilli, available at Korean or Japanese grocers  or Moon Mart) Put the cooked rice, milk and dashi in a 20cm saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring to break up any rice that is stuck together, if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan. The tarak-juk should have a thick, porridge-like consistency. Season the tarak-juk to taste with ground white pepper (a little goes a long way) and a little extra shirodashi, if needed. Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side. Note: If you would like to make dashi from scratch: soak a 12cm piece of kombu in five cups of water overnight, then in the morning, bring kombu and water just to a boil over medium heat. Remove the kombu from the pan and add one cup, or roughly 10g of bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer for 30 seconds and remove from heat. Allow bonito flakes to steep for 10 minutes, then strain.

RON TIPS THE BALANCE The omens are decidedly mixed for Manchester United before their Round of Arsenal tie against Atltico Madrid in Big Cup. On the one hand, they boast a certain Cristiano Ronaldo. Over a long period of time, the old boy has regularly heaped misery upon woe on to Diego Simeones fuming noggin. CR37 scored against Atlti for city neighbours Real to help his side win the 2014 final. He slotted the winning penalty against them in the 2016 final. He swatted them aside in the 2017 semis with a hat-trick, then scored another treble for Juventus in a stupidly dramatic comeback from 2-0 down at this stage in 2019. Its fair to say hes got their number  specifically 25, which is how many goals hes scored in 35 meetings. Poor Diego. Po Diegos a-cold. On the other hand, Atltico can take succour from a little history of their own. On the only other occasion these two clubs have met, in the old Cup Winners Cup in 1991, they trounced United 4-1 on aggregate, prising Lord Fergs fingers off the trophy his side had lifted just six months earlier. Some legendary names were involved in that tie. Paulo Futre opened the scoring for Luis Aragones team as they romped to a 3-0 win in Madrid, while Bernd Schuster equalised in the return at Old Trafford. Uniteds solitary consolation that evening was scored by, who else, a young Cristiano Ronaldo. Subs please check. So if history and mathematics teach us anything, six equals half a dozen. However theres one other, possibly more relevant, factor that may tip the scales decisively in Uniteds balance: Atlti are all over the shop at the minute. While Ralf Rangnicks men are admittedly a mercurial work in progress at best, shambolic if were feeling less generous, theyre a Cityesque model of consistency compared to Simeones shower. World famous as the last word in resolute, no-nonsense, epic outhousery, Atlti have momentarily misplaced their staunch sanitary-chamber mojo, and having lost seven of their last 13, currently exude all the snarling potty-time menace of the Andrex puppy. A statement victory is Uniteds for the taking, as is the chance for Ronaldo to bump up those stats and consign Po Diego to ever more despair.

QUOTE OF THE DAY I asked my mum for speed, but she couldnt give it to me  there were 10,000 boys with more talent on the streets where I come from.

Interviewed after Tuesday nights defeat at home to Wrexham, he commented on the league leaders who did not have a game: Stockport have had a good night tonight without even kicking a ball  thats what footballs about  Brian Ross. All this talk of Aarhus (yesterdays Fiver letters) has reminded me of one of my favourite overseas players at Luton Town: Johnny Vilstrup. He joined for the start of the 1995 season with the most fabulous claim to fame: he had, we were assured, the hardest shot in Denmark. How this was determined was never established and he trundled around the pitch for a few weeks to little effect until Terry Westley was sacked. Although I do have one memory of a bazooka-like shot that left the crossbar oscillating. His replacement, Lennie Lawrence, promptly sent Johnny back to Denmark  to Aarhus, whom he helped win the Danish Cup the following year. Sadly, knee-knack ended his career soon after, but presumably that is always a risk when you have a leg like a cannon  Neil Rose. I laughed at least three times while reading yesterdays Fiver [are you OK?  Fiver Ed]. May I suggest that you stick to politics  Darren Leathley. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Manchester Citys Oleksandr Zinchenko has had his say on the crisis brewing in his homeland as fears of a war with Russia grow. My country belongs to Ukrainians and no one will ever be able to appropriate it, he said. Birmingham striker Troy Deeney has made an impassioned plea for the English school curriculum to be made more diverse. The importance of education at an early age to inform identity and combat racist beliefs and stereotypes cannot be understated, he wrote in an open letter to education secretary Nadhim Zahawi.

All this talk of Aarhus (yesterdays Fiver letters) has reminded me of one of my favourite overseas players at Luton Town: Johnny Vilstrup. He joined for the start of the 1995 season with the most fabulous claim to fame: he had, we were assured, the hardest shot in Denmark. How this was determined was never established and he trundled around the pitch for a few weeks to little effect until Terry Westley was sacked. Although I do have one memory of a bazooka-like shot that left the crossbar oscillating. His replacement, Lennie Lawrence, promptly sent Johnny back to Denmark  to Aarhus, whom he helped win the Danish Cup the following year.

RON TIPS THE BALANCE The omens are decidedly mixed for Manchester United before their Round of Arsenal tie against Atltico Madrid in Big Cup. On the one hand, they boast a certain Cristiano Ronaldo. Over a long period of time, the old boy has regularly heaped misery upon woe on to Diego Simeones fuming noggin. CR37 scored against Atlti for city neighbours Real to help his side win the 2014 final. He slotted the winning penalty against them in the 2016 final. He swatted them aside in the 2017 semis with a hat-trick, then scored another treble for Juventus in a stupidly dramatic comeback from 2-0 down at this stage in 2019. Its fair to say hes got their number  specifically 25, which is how many goals hes scored in 35 meetings. Poor Diego. Po Diegos a-cold. On the other hand, Atltico can take succour from a little history of their own. On the only other occasion these two clubs have met, in the old Cup Winners Cup in 1991, they trounced United 4-1 on aggregate, prising Lord Fergs fingers off the trophy his side had lifted just six months earlier. Some legendary names were involved in that tie. Paulo Futre opened the scoring for Luis Aragones team as they romped to a 3-0 win in Madrid, while Bernd Schuster equalised in the return at Old Trafford. Uniteds solitary consolation that evening was scored by, who else, a young Cristiano Ronaldo. Subs please check. So if history and mathematics teach us anything, six equals half a dozen. However theres one other, possibly more relevant, factor that may tip the scales decisively in Uniteds balance: Atlti are all over the shop at the minute. While Ralf Rangnicks men are admittedly a mercurial work in progress at best, shambolic if were feeling less generous, theyre a Cityesque model of consistency compared to Simeones shower.

RON TIPS THE BALANCE The omens are decidedly mixed for Manchester United before their Round of Arsenal tie against Atltico Madrid in Big Cup. On the one hand, they boast a certain Cristiano Ronaldo. Over a long period of time, the old boy has regularly heaped misery upon woe on to Diego Simeones fuming noggin. CR37 scored against Atlti for city neighbours Real to help his side win the 2014 final. He slotted the winning penalty against them in the 2016 final. He swatted them aside in the 2017 semis with a hat-trick, then scored another treble for Juventus in a stupidly dramatic comeback from 2-0 down at this stage in 2019. Its fair to say hes got their number  specifically 25, which is how many goals hes scored in 35 meetings. Poor Diego. Po Diegos a-cold. On the other hand, Atltico can take succour from a little history of their own. On the only other occasion these two clubs have met, in the old Cup Winners Cup in 1991, they trounced United 4-1 on aggregate, prising Lord Fergs fingers off the trophy his side had lifted just six months earlier. Some legendary names were involved in that tie. Paulo Futre opened the scoring for Luis Aragones team as they romped to a 3-0 win in Madrid, while Bernd Schuster equalised in the return at Old Trafford. Uniteds solitary consolation that evening was scored by, who else, a young Cristiano Ronaldo. Subs please check. So if history and mathematics teach us anything, six equals half a dozen. However theres one other, possibly more relevant, factor that may tip the scales decisively in Uniteds balance: Atlti are all over the shop at the minute. While Ralf Rangnicks men are admittedly a mercurial work in progress at best, shambolic if were feeling less generous, theyre a Cityesque model of consistency compared to Simeones shower. World famous as the last word in resolute, no-nonsense, epic outhousery, Atlti have momentarily misplaced their staunch sanitary-chamber mojo, and having lost seven of their last 13, currently exude all the snarling potty-time menace of the Andrex puppy. A statement victory is Uniteds for the taking, as is the chance for Ronaldo to bump up those stats and consign Po Diego to ever more despair.

QUOTE OF THE DAY I asked my mum for speed, but she couldnt give it to me  there were 10,000 boys with more talent on the streets where I come from.

Seems there is support for the STOP FOOTBALL campaign from Paul Cook, manager of Chesterfield. Interviewed after Tuesday nights defeat at home to Wrexham, he commented on the league leaders who did not have a game: Stockport have had a good night tonight without even kicking a ball  thats what footballs about  Brian Ross. All this talk of Aarhus (yesterdays Fiver letters) has reminded me of one of my favourite overseas players at Luton Town: Johnny Vilstrup. He joined for the start of the 1995 season with the most fabulous claim to fame: he had, we were assured, the hardest shot in Denmark. How this was determined was never established and he trundled around the pitch for a few weeks to little effect until Terry Westley was sacked. Although I do have one memory of a bazooka-like shot that left the crossbar oscillating. His replacement, Lennie Lawrence, promptly sent Johnny back to Denmark  to Aarhus, whom he helped win the Danish Cup the following year. Sadly, knee-knack ended his career soon after, but presumably that is always a risk when you have a leg like a cannon  Neil Rose.

World famous as the last word in resolute, no-nonsense, epic outhousery, Atlti have momentarily misplaced their staunch sanitary-chamber mojo, and having lost seven of their last 13, currently exude all the snarling potty-time menace of the Andrex puppy. A statement victory is Uniteds for the taking, as is the chance for Ronaldo to bump up those stats and consign Po Diego to ever more despair.

FULL BACKING OF THE DAY 19 February: Were fully behind Keith [Millen] and once the new players fully settle and some of the [knacked] players are back, we think well be putting a team out there that will do [us] proud  Carlisle director of football David Holdsworth says the League Two strugglers have the managers back after a 3-0 home defeat by Swindon left them second bottom and potentially needing another Jimmy Glass moment to survive. 23 February: Everyone would like to go on record with their thanks to Keith for his work and efforts since he joined us  and we wish him the very best as he moves on  Carlisle mutually consent Millen and Holdsworth through the door marked Do One, with Paul Simpson coming in. FIVER LETTERS I see The Fiver is getting really good at predicting Big Cup scores (yesterdays Live on Big Website). Careful, or youll increase the readership  Steve Anniss (and 1,056 others). Seems there is support for the STOP FOOTBALL campaign from Paul Cook, manager of Chesterfield. Interviewed after Tuesday nights defeat at home to Wrexham, he commented on the league leaders who did not have a game: Stockport have had a good night tonight without even kicking a ball  thats what footballs about  Brian Ross. All this talk of Aarhus (yesterdays Fiver letters) has reminded me of one of my favourite overseas players at Luton Town: Johnny Vilstrup. He joined for the start of the 1995 season with the most fabulous claim to fame: he had, we were assured, the hardest shot in Denmark. How this was determined was never established and he trundled around the pitch for a few weeks to little effect until Terry Westley was sacked. Although I do have one memory of a bazooka-like shot that left the crossbar oscillating. His replacement, Lennie Lawrence, promptly sent Johnny back to Denmark  to Aarhus, whom he helped win the Danish Cup the following year. Sadly, knee-knack ended his career soon after, but presumably that is always a risk when you have a leg like a cannon  Neil Rose.

Diego isnt here any more, Robert Moreno is, Robert Moreno said, but now he has gone too, Granada announcing that they had sacked their coach in a brief statement released at 12.37am on Saturday shortly after landing from Valencia. Eighteen minutes later, the B-team coach Rubn Torrecilla was named as his replacement. Moreno hadnt lasted long  it is five-and-a-half months since that line, tone set early, and six-and-a-half since his first game  but it was longer than he had ever lasted before and longer than many expected, or wanted. Two days on, no-one has said goodbye. When he left the training ground on Sunday, Moreno did so quietly. He had taken charge of 29 games at Granada, 27 in the league and two in the cup, which at least was 13 more than his previous job, at Monaco. He was in the job before that, his first as head coach, for nine matches but those had been successful and his departure was supposed to be good news even for him. Assistant at the seleccin, he was made Spains caretaker until his friend Luis Enrique felt ready to return following his daughters diagnosis with cancer. There came a point when he didnt seem to see it that way, though, which is why his tenure ended the way it did, in tears. That time, they were only his. When he left Monaco, he claimed that he found players and staff crying at the news that he wasnt going to continue. This time, there are none. Granada have not won this year, picking up three points from nine, Saturdays 3-1 loss at Mestalla their sixth in seven games. They are a single pointabove the relegation zone and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atltico Mancha Real, a team currently battling relegation from the regional, fourth-tier Segunda RFEF division. But thats not the only reason there was something oddly inevitable about this almost from the start, why his brief spell in charge might have been briefer, one paper describing the chronicle of a sacking foretold. The eighth manager sacked in primera this season could have been the first. Something never really felt right, even with the early optimism. Employed by the board before the new sporting director had arrived, the personal choice of director general Patricia Rodrguez, Moreno replaced Diego Martnez, which was some cross to bear. Martnez, the most successful manager the club ever had, brought them up and led them into Europe for the first time ever, reaching the quarter-finals and a meeting with Manchester United. Impossibly energetic, charismatic and hugely popular, he had built a team that was very much his. And even though he studiously stayed away, refusing to set foot in the stadium or be seen anywhere near it, heading to England at one point, Rodrguez admitted the former coach cast a long shadow. Following him wasnt going to be easy. Moreno knew that, which was part of the reason it was even harder for him. This team reached the summit, now it has to leap for the moon, Moreno told Ideal not long after arriving. While survival was the objective, he said they would look to Europe too, suggesting that this team could be better than that one. More stylish, purer, a better football team. Instead, Granada were soon heading downhill. They didnt wake up until September ended, finally collecting their first win at the start of October by beating Sevilla. The problem was that Granada only won one of the next seven, and it wasnt even just that: it was him. Even if you couldnt quite put your finger on why, you wondered how long he would last as early as August. When fans started chanting Robert, vete ya!  Robert, go now  fewer than seven games into the season, you thought he really might be gone soon. And nor was it just results: it was something simpler, something almost too basic. He just didnt feel like he belonged, like he was theirs. Moreno hadnt exactly been given time and as the song went round, there was an ironic smile that made it worse. Afterwards, swivelling in his chair, shrugging a so?, he reminded them that Martnez wasnt coming back. When Luis Enrique returned to the Spain job after the tragic death of his daughter, taking over from Moreno again, he publicly attacked his former assistant and now former friend for being disloyal and over-ambitious, immediately ditching him from his staff as he kept the rest. Moreno had initially said that he would be delighted to step aside but, after seven wins and two draws in nine games, he had started to think he might lead them into the Euros  and suggested that Luis Enrique wait. Life shows you who people are, Luis Enrique said of Moreno. He labelled me with two very ugly things that I dont deserve. I am not that, Moreno insisted. He was probably right, but perhaps that lingered, conditioned the way he was seen. When he went to Monaco, he said that he had offers from the five continents but, interrupted by the pandemic, it didnt work out. At Granada there was something in his attempts to distance himself from Martnez that felt almost dismissive, and fans who saw a man not so much trying to step out of Martnezs shadow as fight his way out  and they didnt much appreciate the punches thrown. They detected a hint of superiority that may not have been fair but they couldnt help feeling it. Young, handsome, proud, they saw something a little chulo in him: chest out, jaw out too, pouting and defiant, defensive. At one press conference in December, the tension came to the surface. Asked about opponents Atltico, he replied: I dont have to answer that. What about the four-four-two which seems to be going well, he was asked: Thats why I use it. Asked how defender Quini was: You have to ask him. Will you rotate? Tomorrow youll see. The next day he apologised, insisting: Im a human and I make mistakes  it was not my best day for personal reasons, he said, noting that he had been trending on Twitter. All of which was fair enough  it is a miracle that players and managers dont get shirty more often  but there wasnt a great deal of warmth, even when they were winning. Which by then they were. That day, they defeated Atltico  part of a run of seven without defeat, equalling a club record. If there was a feeling that patience may have been rewarded, that they had found their feet, the manager accepting petitions to be more pragmatic, somehow there was still something they were not sure of, little affection. And then, despite spending 10m in the winter, they stopped winning again. Atltico was their last victory, and that was nine games ago. And so it ends, early but later than it might have done, resistance from the clubs ownership in China finally overcome after a couple of weeks on edge and a season that never truly felt secure. Granada have won only five league games from 27. On Saturday the captain Germn Snchez insisted that the players believed in Moreno but no one has said anything since, no farewell and no thanks. The wife of Luis Abram, currently out on loan, declared: At last! Im sure better things will come. They have to: next up, Granada face Elche, four points ahead of them, and Alavs, who are three points behind. New manager, guaranteed victory, the line goes and they had to try something. Besides, it has worked for others, not just at Barcelona but at the bottom, too. Levante went from no wins in eight to no wins in 15 when they changed from Paco Lpez to Javier Pereira, but have a weensy bit of a chance now with Alessio Lisci in charge. Theres a glimpse of hope emerging at Alavs who have won one and drawn two of their last four under Jos Luis Mendilbar. Under Fran Escrib, Elche won two of 14 and were 18th; under Francisco, theyve won five and are five points clear of the relegation zone. Cdiz, who sacked lvaro Cervera, are one point from safety having just won a top-flight game in front of their home fans for the first time since 2006. And Quique Snchez Flores has performed a miracle at Getafe. At the same time as Getafe sacked Mchel and Levante bade farewell to Paco Lpez, with fans singing for Robert to go now and many wondering if that might not be a bad idea, Granada won their first game of the season. A liberation, Moreno called it, but it didnt last and now he has gone too.

Afterwards, swivelling in his chair, shrugging a so?, he reminded them that Martnez wasnt coming back. When Luis Enrique returned to the Spain job after the tragic death of his daughter, taking over from Moreno again, he publicly attacked his former assistant and now former friend for being disloyal and over-ambitious, immediately ditching him from his staff as he kept the rest. Moreno had initially said that he would be delighted to step aside but, after seven wins and two draws in nine games, he had started to think he might lead them into the Euros  and suggested that Luis Enrique wait. Life shows you who people are, Luis Enrique said of Moreno. He labelled me with two very ugly things that I dont deserve. I am not that, Moreno insisted. He was probably right, but perhaps that lingered, conditioned the way he was seen. When he went to Monaco, he said that he had offers from the five continents but, interrupted by the pandemic, it didnt work out. At Granada there was something in his attempts to distance himself from Martnez that felt almost dismissive, and fans who saw a man not so much trying to step out of Martnezs shadow as fight his way out  and they didnt much appreciate the punches thrown. They detected a hint of superiority that may not have been fair but they couldnt help feeling it. Young, handsome, proud, they saw something a little chulo in him: chest out, jaw out too, pouting and defiant, defensive. At one press conference in December, the tension came to the surface. Asked about opponents Atltico, he replied: I dont have to answer that. What about the four-four-two which seems to be going well, he was asked: Thats why I use it. Asked how defender Quini was: You have to ask him. Will you rotate? Tomorrow youll see. The next day he apologised, insisting: Im a human and I make mistakes  it was not my best day for personal reasons, he said, noting that he had been trending on Twitter. All of which was fair enough  it is a miracle that players and managers dont get shirty more often  but there wasnt a great deal of warmth, even when they were winning. Which by then they were. That day, they defeated Atltico  part of a run of seven without defeat, equalling a club record. If there was a feeling that patience may have been rewarded, that they had found their feet, the manager accepting petitions to be more pragmatic, somehow there was still something they were not sure of, little affection. And then, despite spending 10m in the winter, they stopped winning again. Atltico was their last victory, and that was nine games ago. And so it ends, early but later than it might have done, resistance from the clubs ownership in China finally overcome after a couple of weeks on edge and a season that never truly felt secure. Granada have won only five league games from 27. On Saturday the captain Germn Snchez insisted that the players believed in Moreno but no one has said anything since, no farewell and no thanks. The wife of Luis Abram, currently out on loan, declared: At last! Im sure better things will come. They have to: next up, Granada face Elche, four points ahead of them, and Alavs, who are three points behind. New manager, guaranteed victory, the line goes and they had to try something. Besides, it has worked for others, not just at Barcelona but at the bottom, too. Levante went from no wins in eight to no wins in 15 when they changed from Paco Lpez to Javier Pereira, but have a weensy bit of a chance now with Alessio Lisci in charge. Theres a glimpse of hope emerging at Alavs who have won one and drawn two of their last four under Jos Luis Mendilbar. Under Fran Escrib, Elche won two of 14 and were 18th; under Francisco, theyve won five and are five points clear of the relegation zone. Cdiz, who sacked lvaro Cervera, are one point from safety having just won a top-flight game in front of their home fans for the first time since 2006. And Quique Snchez Flores has performed a miracle at Getafe. At the same time as Getafe sacked Mchel and Levante bade farewell to Paco Lpez, with fans singing for Robert to go now and many wondering if that might not be a bad idea, Granada won their first game of the season. A liberation, Moreno called it, but it didnt last and now he has gone too.

Diego isnt here any more, Robert Moreno is, Robert Moreno said, but now he has gone too, Granada announcing that they had sacked their coach in a brief statement released at 12.37am on Saturday shortly after landing from Valencia. Eighteen minutes later, the B-team coach Rubn Torrecilla was named as his replacement. Moreno hadnt lasted long  it is five-and-a-half months since that line, tone set early, and six-and-a-half since his first game  but it was longer than he had ever lasted before and longer than many expected, or wanted. Two days on, no-one has said goodbye. When he left the training ground on Sunday, Moreno did so quietly. He had taken charge of 29 games at Granada, 27 in the league and two in the cup, which at least was 13 more than his previous job, at Monaco. He was in the job before that, his first as head coach, for nine matches but those had been successful and his departure was supposed to be good news even for him. Assistant at the seleccin, he was made Spains caretaker until his friend Luis Enrique felt ready to return following his daughters diagnosis with cancer. There came a point when he didnt seem to see it that way, though, which is why his tenure ended the way it did, in tears. That time, they were only his. When he left Monaco, he claimed that he found players and staff crying at the news that he wasnt going to continue. This time, there are none. Granada have not won this year, picking up three points from nine, Saturdays 3-1 loss at Mestalla their sixth in seven games. They are a single pointabove the relegation zone and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atltico Mancha Real, a team currently battling relegation from the regional, fourth-tier Segunda RFEF division. But thats not the only reason there was something oddly inevitable about this almost from the start, why his brief spell in charge might have been briefer, one paper describing the chronicle of a sacking foretold. The eighth manager sacked in primera this season could have been the first. Something never really felt right, even with the early optimism. Employed by the board before the new sporting director had arrived, the personal choice of director general Patricia Rodrguez, Moreno replaced Diego Martnez, which was some cross to bear. Martnez, the most successful manager the club ever had, brought them up and led them into Europe for the first time ever, reaching the quarter-finals and a meeting with Manchester United. Impossibly energetic, charismatic and hugely popular, he had built a team that was very much his. And even though he studiously stayed away, refusing to set foot in the stadium or be seen anywhere near it, heading to England at one point, Rodrguez admitted the former coach cast a long shadow. Following him wasnt going to be easy. Moreno knew that, which was part of the reason it was even harder for him. This team reached the summit, now it has to leap for the moon, Moreno told Ideal not long after arriving. While survival was the objective, he said they would look to Europe too, suggesting that this team could be better than that one. More stylish, purer, a better football team. Instead, Granada were soon heading downhill. They didnt wake up until September ended, finally collecting their first win at the start of October by beating Sevilla. The problem was that Granada only won one of the next seven, and it wasnt even just that: it was him. Even if you couldnt quite put your finger on why, you wondered how long he would last as early as August. When fans started chanting Robert, vete ya!  Robert, go now  fewer than seven games into the season, you thought he really might be gone soon. And nor was it just results: it was something simpler, something almost too basic. He just didnt feel like he belonged, like he was theirs. Moreno hadnt exactly been given time and as the song went round, there was an ironic smile that made it worse.

Following him wasnt going to be easy. Moreno knew that, which was part of the reason it was even harder for him. This team reached the summit, now it has to leap for the moon, Moreno told Ideal not long after arriving. While survival was the objective, he said they would look to Europe too, suggesting that this team could be better than that one. More stylish, purer, a better football team. Instead, Granada were soon heading downhill. They didnt wake up until September ended, finally collecting their first win at the start of October by beating Sevilla. The problem was that Granada only won one of the next seven, and it wasnt even just that: it was him. Even if you couldnt quite put your finger on why, you wondered how long he would last as early as August. When fans started chanting Robert, vete ya!  Robert, go now  fewer than seven games into the season, you thought he really might be gone soon. And nor was it just results: it was something simpler, something almost too basic. He just didnt feel like he belonged, like he was theirs. Moreno hadnt exactly been given time and as the song went round, there was an ironic smile that made it worse. Afterwards, swivelling in his chair, shrugging a so?, he reminded them that Martnez wasnt coming back. When Luis Enrique returned to the Spain job after the tragic death of his daughter, taking over from Moreno again, he publicly attacked his former assistant and now former friend for being disloyal and over-ambitious, immediately ditching him from his staff as he kept the rest. Moreno had initially said that he would be delighted to step aside but, after seven wins and two draws in nine games, he had started to think he might lead them into the Euros  and suggested that Luis Enrique wait. Life shows you who people are, Luis Enrique said of Moreno. He labelled me with two very ugly things that I dont deserve. I am not that, Moreno insisted. He was probably right, but perhaps that lingered, conditioned the way he was seen. When he went to Monaco, he said that he had offers from the five continents but, interrupted by the pandemic, it didnt work out. At Granada there was something in his attempts to distance himself from Martnez that felt almost dismissive, and fans who saw a man not so much trying to step out of Martnezs shadow as fight his way out  and they didnt much appreciate the punches thrown. They detected a hint of superiority that may not have been fair but they couldnt help feeling it. Young, handsome, proud, they saw something a little chulo in him: chest out, jaw out too, pouting and defiant, defensive. At one press conference in December, the tension came to the surface. Asked about opponents Atltico, he replied: I dont have to answer that. What about the four-four-two which seems to be going well, he was asked: Thats why I use it. Asked how defender Quini was: You have to ask him. Will you rotate? Tomorrow youll see. The next day he apologised, insisting: Im a human and I make mistakes  it was not my best day for personal reasons, he said, noting that he had been trending on Twitter. All of which was fair enough  it is a miracle that players and managers dont get shirty more often  but there wasnt a great deal of warmth, even when they were winning. Which by then they were. That day, they defeated Atltico  part of a run of seven without defeat, equalling a club record. If there was a feeling that patience may have been rewarded, that they had found their feet, the manager accepting petitions to be more pragmatic, somehow there was still something they were not sure of, little affection. And then, despite spending 10m in the winter, they stopped winning again. Atltico was their last victory, and that was nine games ago. And so it ends, early but later than it might have done, resistance from the clubs ownership in China finally overcome after a couple of weeks on edge and a season that never truly felt secure. Granada have won only five league games from 27. On Saturday the captain Germn Snchez insisted that the players believed in Moreno but no one has said anything since, no farewell and no thanks. The wife of Luis Abram, currently out on loan, declared: At last! Im sure better things will come. They have to: next up, Granada face Elche, four points ahead of them, and Alavs, who are three points behind. New manager, guaranteed victory, the line goes and they had to try something. Besides, it has worked for others, not just at Barcelona but at the bottom, too. Levante went from no wins in eight to no wins in 15 when they changed from Paco Lpez to Javier Pereira, but have a weensy bit of a chance now with Alessio Lisci in charge. Theres a glimpse of hope emerging at Alavs who have won one and drawn two of their last four under Jos Luis Mendilbar. Under Fran Escrib, Elche won two of 14 and were 18th; under Francisco, theyve won five and are five points clear of the relegation zone. Cdiz, who sacked lvaro Cervera, are one point from safety having just won a top-flight game in front of their home fans for the first time since 2006. And Quique Snchez Flores has performed a miracle at Getafe. At the same time as Getafe sacked Mchel and Levante bade farewell to Paco Lpez, with fans singing for Robert to go now and many wondering if that might not be a bad idea, Granada won their first game of the season. A liberation, Moreno called it, but it didnt last and now he has gone too.

Diego isnt here any more, Robert Moreno is, Robert Moreno said, but now he has gone too, Granada announcing that they had sacked their coach in a brief statement released at 12.37am on Saturday shortly after landing from Valencia. Eighteen minutes later, the B-team coach Rubn Torrecilla was named as his replacement. Moreno hadnt lasted long  it is five-and-a-half months since that line, tone set early, and six-and-a-half since his first game  but it was longer than he had ever lasted before and longer than many expected, or wanted. Two days on, no-one has said goodbye. When he left the training ground on Sunday, Moreno did so quietly. He had taken charge of 29 games at Granada, 27 in the league and two in the cup, which at least was 13 more than his previous job, at Monaco. He was in the job before that, his first as head coach, for nine matches but those had been successful and his departure was supposed to be good news even for him. Assistant at the seleccin, he was made Spains caretaker until his friend Luis Enrique felt ready to return following his daughters diagnosis with cancer. There came a point when he didnt seem to see it that way, though, which is why his tenure ended the way it did, in tears. That time, they were only his. When he left Monaco, he claimed that he found players and staff crying at the news that he wasnt going to continue. This time, there are none. Granada have not won this year, picking up three points from nine, Saturdays 3-1 loss at Mestalla their sixth in seven games. They are a single pointabove the relegation zone and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atltico Mancha Real, a team currently battling relegation from the regional, fourth-tier Segunda RFEF division. But thats not the only reason there was something oddly inevitable about this almost from the start, why his brief spell in charge might have been briefer, one paper describing the chronicle of a sacking foretold. The eighth manager sacked in primera this season could have been the first. Something never really felt right, even with the early optimism. Employed by the board before the new sporting director had arrived, the personal choice of director general Patricia Rodrguez, Moreno replaced Diego Martnez, which was some cross to bear. Martnez, the most successful manager the club ever had, brought them up and led them into Europe for the first time ever, reaching the quarter-finals and a meeting with Manchester United. Impossibly energetic, charismatic and hugely popular, he had built a team that was very much his. And even though he studiously stayed away, refusing to set foot in the stadium or be seen anywhere near it, heading to England at one point, Rodrguez admitted the former coach cast a long shadow.

They are a single pointabove the relegation zone and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atltico Mancha Real, a team currently battling relegation from the regional, fourth-tier Segunda RFEF division. But thats not the only reason there was something oddly inevitable about this almost from the start, why his brief spell in charge might have been briefer, one paper describing the chronicle of a sacking foretold. The eighth manager sacked in primera this season could have been the first. Something never really felt right, even with the early optimism. Employed by the board before the new sporting director had arrived, the personal choice of director general Patricia Rodrguez, Moreno replaced Diego Martnez, which was some cross to bear. Martnez, the most successful manager the club ever had, brought them up and led them into Europe for the first time ever, reaching the quarter-finals and a meeting with Manchester United. Impossibly energetic, charismatic and hugely popular, he had built a team that was very much his. And even though he studiously stayed away, refusing to set foot in the stadium or be seen anywhere near it, heading to England at one point, Rodrguez admitted the former coach cast a long shadow. Following him wasnt going to be easy. Moreno knew that, which was part of the reason it was even harder for him. This team reached the summit, now it has to leap for the moon, Moreno told Ideal not long after arriving. While survival was the objective, he said they would look to Europe too, suggesting that this team could be better than that one. More stylish, purer, a better football team. Instead, Granada were soon heading downhill. They didnt wake up until September ended, finally collecting their first win at the start of October by beating Sevilla. The problem was that Granada only won one of the next seven, and it wasnt even just that: it was him. Even if you couldnt quite put your finger on why, you wondered how long he would last as early as August. When fans started chanting Robert, vete ya!  Robert, go now  fewer than seven games into the season, you thought he really might be gone soon. And nor was it just results: it was something simpler, something almost too basic. He just didnt feel like he belonged, like he was theirs. Moreno hadnt exactly been given time and as the song went round, there was an ironic smile that made it worse. Afterwards, swivelling in his chair, shrugging a so?, he reminded them that Martnez wasnt coming back. When Luis Enrique returned to the Spain job after the tragic death of his daughter, taking over from Moreno again, he publicly attacked his former assistant and now former friend for being disloyal and over-ambitious, immediately ditching him from his staff as he kept the rest. Moreno had initially said that he would be delighted to step aside but, after seven wins and two draws in nine games, he had started to think he might lead them into the Euros  and suggested that Luis Enrique wait. Life shows you who people are, Luis Enrique said of Moreno. He labelled me with two very ugly things that I dont deserve. I am not that, Moreno insisted. He was probably right, but perhaps that lingered, conditioned the way he was seen. When he went to Monaco, he said that he had offers from the five continents but, interrupted by the pandemic, it didnt work out. At Granada there was something in his attempts to distance himself from Martnez that felt almost dismissive, and fans who saw a man not so much trying to step out of Martnezs shadow as fight his way out  and they didnt much appreciate the punches thrown. They detected a hint of superiority that may not have been fair but they couldnt help feeling it. Young, handsome, proud, they saw something a little chulo in him: chest out, jaw out too, pouting and defiant, defensive. At one press conference in December, the tension came to the surface. Asked about opponents Atltico, he replied: I dont have to answer that. What about the four-four-two which seems to be going well, he was asked: Thats why I use it. Asked how defender Quini was: You have to ask him. Will you rotate? Tomorrow youll see. The next day he apologised, insisting: Im a human and I make mistakes  it was not my best day for personal reasons, he said, noting that he had been trending on Twitter. All of which was fair enough  it is a miracle that players and managers dont get shirty more often  but there wasnt a great deal of warmth, even when they were winning. Which by then they were. That day, they defeated Atltico  part of a run of seven without defeat, equalling a club record. If there was a feeling that patience may have been rewarded, that they had found their feet, the manager accepting petitions to be more pragmatic, somehow there was still something they were not sure of, little affection. And then, despite spending 10m in the winter, they stopped winning again. Atltico was their last victory, and that was nine games ago. And so it ends, early but later than it might have done, resistance from the clubs ownership in China finally overcome after a couple of weeks on edge and a season that never truly felt secure. Granada have won only five league games from 27. On Saturday the captain Germn Snchez insisted that the players believed in Moreno but no one has said anything since, no farewell and no thanks. The wife of Luis Abram, currently out on loan, declared: At last! Im sure better things will come. They have to: next up, Granada face Elche, four points ahead of them, and Alavs, who are three points behind. New manager, guaranteed victory, the line goes and they had to try something. Besides, it has worked for others, not just at Barcelona but at the bottom, too. Levante went from no wins in eight to no wins in 15 when they changed from Paco Lpez to Javier Pereira, but have a weensy bit of a chance now with Alessio Lisci in charge. Theres a glimpse of hope emerging at Alavs who have won one and drawn two of their last four under Jos Luis Mendilbar. Under Fran Escrib, Elche won two of 14 and were 18th; under Francisco, theyve won five and are five points clear of the relegation zone. Cdiz, who sacked lvaro Cervera, are one point from safety having just won a top-flight game in front of their home fans for the first time since 2006. And Quique Snchez Flores has performed a miracle at Getafe. At the same time as Getafe sacked Mchel and Levante bade farewell to Paco Lpez, with fans singing for Robert to go now and many wondering if that might not be a bad idea, Granada won their first game of the season. A liberation, Moreno called it, but it didnt last and now he has gone too.

Diego isnt here any more, Robert Moreno is, Robert Moreno said, but now he has gone too, Granada announcing that they had sacked their coach in a brief statement released at 12.37am on Saturday shortly after landing from Valencia. Eighteen minutes later, the B-team coach Rubn Torrecilla was named as his replacement. Moreno hadnt lasted long  it is five-and-a-half months since that line, tone set early, and six-and-a-half since his first game  but it was longer than he had ever lasted before and longer than many expected, or wanted. Two days on, no-one has said goodbye. When he left the training ground on Sunday, Moreno did so quietly. He had taken charge of 29 games at Granada, 27 in the league and two in the cup, which at least was 13 more than his previous job, at Monaco. He was in the job before that, his first as head coach, for nine matches but those had been successful and his departure was supposed to be good news even for him. Assistant at the seleccin, he was made Spains caretaker until his friend Luis Enrique felt ready to return following his daughters diagnosis with cancer. There came a point when he didnt seem to see it that way, though, which is why his tenure ended the way it did, in tears. That time, they were only his. When he left Monaco, he claimed that he found players and staff crying at the news that he wasnt going to continue. This time, there are none. Granada have not won this year, picking up three points from nine, Saturdays 3-1 loss at Mestalla their sixth in seven games.

Stamford Bridge was a crisp, clear, boisterous place at kick-off in this last-16 first leg, the air crackling with a comforting midweek energy under those low white lights. And for the next 90 minutes two things happened. First up there was that unavoidable sense of wider turmoil. What a strange, fraught occasion this was for the worlds most guilelessly weaponised sport, another turn as the hot dog seller in the background of history, a bumbling tourist on the front line of world events. At lunchtime Roman Abramovichs name had been bandied about the houses of parliament, the British prime minister insisting (incorrectly, it was later withdrawn) that sanctions were already in operation against Chelseas owner. By late evening this had been translated through the lens of midweek football into a meeting of English and French champions in the Gazprom-sponsored Uefa Champions League, with an unavoidable sense of interlocking fingers entwined around this occasion. In the middle of which, as ever, a game of football broke out. Geopolitical tensions may come and go. But we will always have neat, tactically astute Chelsea Champions League knockout victories. And from a certain angle this was almost a parody of the form: clean sheet, set-piece goal, NGolo Kant breakaway, good hustle, nice patterns, Thomas Tuchel on his feet having an ongoing, deeply personal argument with his disobedient invisible twin. Chelsea were excellent in many ways, a team working in sync and offering by the end the clearest demonstration  in his absence  of what exactly is eating Romelu Lukaku. Tuchel lined up his team with seven essentially defensive outfield players here and a Pulisic-Ziyech-Havertz front three that did not so much scream goals as whisper it very quietly through the sleeve of a heavy woollen jumper. By 79 minutes he had used four subs, none of whom was Lukaku. Timo Werner was out there, wheeling around like a runaway shopping trolley. But Werner also works like a mad thing in deep areas. It took him eight minutes to make it to seven touches. Tuchel said after the game that he left Lukaku out because he was tired. What was most notable was how utterly out of kilter with the rest of this team he looks these days. Here Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz worked like Trojans in attack, running not just the channels but every channel, shuttling up and down the pitch utterly in tune with the collective effort. It was Havertz who made the difference early on, when he seemed to have a kind of invisibility cloak, penetrating the sovereign borders of the Lille six-yard box three times in quick succession. The last of these saw him force the corner from which he opened the scoring on eight minutes with a nicely timed run and a header. It is easy to forget how young he still is. In outline he has every attribute, from that compelling rangy stride, a footballer who looks as though he has strayed on to the pitch from some passing student charity half marathon, to the relentless ghosting movement. With 67 minutes gone he was back by his own corner flag, blocking off a forward run, hustling a Lille throw-in, doing deep, tactical, textural things. He is perfect for Tuchel, too. Chelseas manager wants control above all. Here he leapt up repeatedly, skinny ankles pounding the touchline, arms describing unknowable geometric shapes in the air. The thing that gets him most is failed turnovers, an inability to bite in at the right moment. And it was from there that the second goal came, made by the master of the creative turnover, and the games best player on the night. Kant took the ball in the centre circle, saw a sliver of green and surged away, still so wonderfully light across the turf, then played the perfect pass at the perfect pace to Pulisic. His finish was expertly taken, garland to a fine, energetic performance. And that was pretty much that. There was time for Tuchel to have another tantrum on the touchline, hands thrashing at the air like a man being menaced by a swarm of crows. At that precise moment Chelsea were funnelling the ball about at the back, the game at a standstill. But Tuchel had seen lines, shadows, peril, misaligned objects. This is the level of precision he demands, the level of control freakery. Tuchel might have feigned mild surprise at those seven Lukaku touches against Crystal Palace but he sees all this stuff, just as he must also see his own inability to change that script, or to wring any more from this 90m asset. Leaving Lukaku out here was abrupt and to the point. Chelsea will surely march on from here, but it is hard to see how a performance so tight, so uniform in tone and texture leaves any space for that oddly misaligned record signing. These are the moments that clarify teams, seasons, relationships. This one does not look sustainable.

Stamford Bridge was a crisp, clear, boisterous place at kick-off in this last-16 first leg, the air crackling with a comforting midweek energy under those low white lights. And for the next 90 minutes two things happened. First up there was that unavoidable sense of wider turmoil. What a strange, fraught occasion this was for the worlds most guilelessly weaponised sport, another turn as the hot dog seller in the background of history, a bumbling tourist on the front line of world events. At lunchtime Roman Abramovichs name had been bandied about the houses of parliament, the British prime minister insisting (incorrectly, it was later withdrawn) that sanctions were already in operation against Chelseas owner. By late evening this had been translated through the lens of midweek football into a meeting of English and French champions in the Gazprom-sponsored Uefa Champions League, with an unavoidable sense of interlocking fingers entwined around this occasion. In the middle of which, as ever, a game of football broke out. Geopolitical tensions may come and go. But we will always have neat, tactically astute Chelsea Champions League knockout victories. And from a certain angle this was almost a parody of the form: clean sheet, set-piece goal, NGolo Kant breakaway, good hustle, nice patterns, Thomas Tuchel on his feet having an ongoing, deeply personal argument with his disobedient invisible twin. Chelsea were excellent in many ways, a team working in sync and offering by the end the clearest demonstration  in his absence  of what exactly is eating Romelu Lukaku. Tuchel lined up his team with seven essentially defensive outfield players here and a Pulisic-Ziyech-Havertz front three that did not so much scream goals as whisper it very quietly through the sleeve of a heavy woollen jumper. By 79 minutes he had used four subs, none of whom was Lukaku. Timo Werner was out there, wheeling around like a runaway shopping trolley. But Werner also works like a mad thing in deep areas. It took him eight minutes to make it to seven touches. Tuchel said after the game that he left Lukaku out because he was tired. What was most notable was how utterly out of kilter with the rest of this team he looks these days. Here Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz worked like Trojans in attack, running not just the channels but every channel, shuttling up and down the pitch utterly in tune with the collective effort. It was Havertz who made the difference early on, when he seemed to have a kind of invisibility cloak, penetrating the sovereign borders of the Lille six-yard box three times in quick succession. The last of these saw him force the corner from which he opened the scoring on eight minutes with a nicely timed run and a header. It is easy to forget how young he still is. In outline he has every attribute, from that compelling rangy stride, a footballer who looks as though he has strayed on to the pitch from some passing student charity half marathon, to the relentless ghosting movement. With 67 minutes gone he was back by his own corner flag, blocking off a forward run, hustling a Lille throw-in, doing deep, tactical, textural things. He is perfect for Tuchel, too. Chelseas manager wants control above all. Here he leapt up repeatedly, skinny ankles pounding the touchline, arms describing unknowable geometric shapes in the air. The thing that gets him most is failed turnovers, an inability to bite in at the right moment. And it was from there that the second goal came, made by the master of the creative turnover, and the games best player on the night. Kant took the ball in the centre circle, saw a sliver of green and surged away, still so wonderfully light across the turf, then played the perfect pass at the perfect pace to Pulisic. His finish was expertly taken, garland to a fine, energetic performance. And that was pretty much that. There was time for Tuchel to have another tantrum on the touchline, hands thrashing at the air like a man being menaced by a swarm of crows. At that precise moment Chelsea were funnelling the ball about at the back, the game at a standstill. But Tuchel had seen lines, shadows, peril, misaligned objects.

Tuchel lined up his team with seven essentially defensive outfield players here and a Pulisic-Ziyech-Havertz front three that did not so much scream goals as whisper it very quietly through the sleeve of a heavy woollen jumper. By 79 minutes he had used four subs, none of whom was Lukaku. Timo Werner was out there, wheeling around like a runaway shopping trolley. But Werner also works like a mad thing in deep areas. It took him eight minutes to make it to seven touches. Tuchel said after the game that he left Lukaku out because he was tired. What was most notable was how utterly out of kilter with the rest of this team he looks these days. Here Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz worked like Trojans in attack, running not just the channels but every channel, shuttling up and down the pitch utterly in tune with the collective effort. It was Havertz who made the difference early on, when he seemed to have a kind of invisibility cloak, penetrating the sovereign borders of the Lille six-yard box three times in quick succession. The last of these saw him force the corner from which he opened the scoring on eight minutes with a nicely timed run and a header. It is easy to forget how young he still is. In outline he has every attribute, from that compelling rangy stride, a footballer who looks as though he has strayed on to the pitch from some passing student charity half marathon, to the relentless ghosting movement. With 67 minutes gone he was back by his own corner flag, blocking off a forward run, hustling a Lille throw-in, doing deep, tactical, textural things. He is perfect for Tuchel, too. Chelseas manager wants control above all. Here he leapt up repeatedly, skinny ankles pounding the touchline, arms describing unknowable geometric shapes in the air. The thing that gets him most is failed turnovers, an inability to bite in at the right moment. And it was from there that the second goal came, made by the master of the creative turnover, and the games best player on the night. Kant took the ball in the centre circle, saw a sliver of green and surged away, still so wonderfully light across the turf, then played the perfect pass at the perfect pace to Pulisic. His finish was expertly taken, garland to a fine, energetic performance. And that was pretty much that. There was time for Tuchel to have another tantrum on the touchline, hands thrashing at the air like a man being menaced by a swarm of crows. At that precise moment Chelsea were funnelling the ball about at the back, the game at a standstill. But Tuchel had seen lines, shadows, peril, misaligned objects. This is the level of precision he demands, the level of control freakery. Tuchel might have feigned mild surprise at those seven Lukaku touches against Crystal Palace but he sees all this stuff, just as he must also see his own inability to change that script, or to wring any more from this 90m asset. Leaving Lukaku out here was abrupt and to the point. Chelsea will surely march on from here, but it is hard to see how a performance so tight, so uniform in tone and texture leaves any space for that oddly misaligned record signing. These are the moments that clarify teams, seasons, relationships. This one does not look sustainable.

Stamford Bridge was a crisp, clear, boisterous place at kick-off in this last-16 first leg, the air crackling with a comforting midweek energy under those low white lights. And for the next 90 minutes two things happened. First up there was that unavoidable sense of wider turmoil. What a strange, fraught occasion this was for the worlds most guilelessly weaponised sport, another turn as the hot dog seller in the background of history, a bumbling tourist on the front line of world events. At lunchtime Roman Abramovichs name had been bandied about the houses of parliament, the British prime minister insisting (incorrectly, it was later withdrawn) that sanctions were already in operation against Chelseas owner. By late evening this had been translated through the lens of midweek football into a meeting of English and French champions in the Gazprom-sponsored Uefa Champions League, with an unavoidable sense of interlocking fingers entwined around this occasion. In the middle of which, as ever, a game of football broke out. Geopolitical tensions may come and go. But we will always have neat, tactically astute Chelsea Champions League knockout victories.

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilsons numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilsons work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilsons work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation.

He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilsons numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilsons work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilsons work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range.

Edward Barness greatest innovation, before he became head of BBC television childrens programmes from 1978 until 1986, lay in creating Newsround. He launched the news programme for young viewers in 1972, after discovering that only 0.7% of his target age group watched TV news: It was a man in a suit, talking, and it was boring, he said. He put John Craven, dressed casually in a sweater, in the presenters chair, initially for a six-week experiment, and the programme went on to become a BBC institution, even breaking major international news stories such as the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Barnes, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, also made a significant, long-lasting contribution as one of those who might be described as a godparent to Blue Peter, which was launched in 1958. He was an occasional floor manager during the shows first four years as it sailed choppy waters with the departure of two presenters and its original producer. Caretaker producers tried to steady the ship while the search went on for a permanent replacement in 1962. Barnes, then working on other BBC programmes as a production assistant, was turned down for the role. Biddy Baxter, who landed the job, had to serve three months notice in her BBC radio producers job, and fought off a suggestion that Barnes should produce Blue Peter until her arrival, concerned that he would not want to give way to a girl from radio. Instead, Leonard Chase assumed the temporary role, with Barnes assisting him, and hired Valerie Singleton to present alongside Christopher Trace. When Baxter took over, Barnes continued as assistant producer and directed the programme. His and Baxters wariness of each other evaporated and together  with Rosemary Gill as researcher  they moulded Blue Peter into a programme that became essential viewing for children. Baxter saw the involvement of viewers as the key to this, introducing makes  items created out of household materials  and annual appeals, and encouraging children to write in with ideas and stories by rewarding them with the famous Blue Peter badge. Barnes thought the programme should have its own distinctive logo, so Tony Hart was commissioned to design the galleon emblem, which featured on the badge. The idea of having a Blue Peter pet came from Barness wife, Dorothy, who scripted picture stories and other items for the show. Unfortunately, the mongrel chosen and introduced to viewers just before Christmas 1962 died of distemper two days later. Well have to get a substitute, said Barnes. The puppys only been seen once. Theres no point in upsetting children needlessly. In freezing snow, he and Baxter drove around London pet shops in his Mini and found a lookalike in Lewisham. Viewers voted to name her Petra, the female form of Peter, and she became the first in a long line of Blue Peter pets. In 1964, the show increased from one to two episodes a week and added John Noakes alongside Trace and Singleton. The following year, when Baxter was made the shows editor  a new title  Barnes and Gill became producers. Barnes was a great defender of his boss, who held an authoritarian grip on the show. He insisted that if, in her quest for perfection, she was ruthless, it was on behalf of the audience. Together, they also staged a fightback when, in 1964, BBC televisions childrens department lost its autonomy, and a new family department was formed out of childrens and womens programmes. We felt betrayed by the BBC, said Barnes, and we thought, Well show them. We wanted to give the management a black eye. Blue Peter and Play School were at the forefront of the battle and the childrens department was restored three years later. Maintaining his association with the show after leaving to become the BBCs assistant head of childrens programmes (1970-78), Barnes produced Blue Peter Royal Safari (1971), with Singleton accompanying Princess Anne on a tour of Kenyan wildlife parks. He also created and produced Blue Peter Special Assignment (1973-81), featuring trips to cities, islands, houses and rivers, initially as a vehicle for Singleton after she left the programme. As deputy to Monica Sims, he created Record Breakers (1972-2001) and Go With Noakes (1976-80) and ruffled some establishment feathers by commissioning Grange Hill (1978-2008), the soap producer Phil Redmonds warts-and-all drama about life in a comprehensive school. Other shows he oversaw or commissioned after taking over from Sims in 1978 included Rentaghost (1976-84), Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82), Think Again (1981-85), with Johnny Ball, Grandad (1979-84), starring Clive Dunn, Postman Pat (1981-96) and Henrys Cat (1983-93). In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992. He is survived by their son, Simon, and two daughters, Rachel and Julia. Anthony Hayward Jeremy Swan writes: Monica Sims was a hard act to follow as head of BBC childrens programmes. But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.

In 1964, the show increased from one to two episodes a week and added John Noakes alongside Trace and Singleton. The following year, when Baxter was made the shows editor  a new title  Barnes and Gill became producers. Barnes was a great defender of his boss, who held an authoritarian grip on the show. He insisted that if, in her quest for perfection, she was ruthless, it was on behalf of the audience. Together, they also staged a fightback when, in 1964, BBC televisions childrens department lost its autonomy, and a new family department was formed out of childrens and womens programmes. We felt betrayed by the BBC, said Barnes, and we thought, Well show them. We wanted to give the management a black eye. Blue Peter and Play School were at the forefront of the battle and the childrens department was restored three years later. Maintaining his association with the show after leaving to become the BBCs assistant head of childrens programmes (1970-78), Barnes produced Blue Peter Royal Safari (1971), with Singleton accompanying Princess Anne on a tour of Kenyan wildlife parks. He also created and produced Blue Peter Special Assignment (1973-81), featuring trips to cities, islands, houses and rivers, initially as a vehicle for Singleton after she left the programme. As deputy to Monica Sims, he created Record Breakers (1972-2001) and Go With Noakes (1976-80) and ruffled some establishment feathers by commissioning Grange Hill (1978-2008), the soap producer Phil Redmonds warts-and-all drama about life in a comprehensive school. Other shows he oversaw or commissioned after taking over from Sims in 1978 included Rentaghost (1976-84), Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82), Think Again (1981-85), with Johnny Ball, Grandad (1979-84), starring Clive Dunn, Postman Pat (1981-96) and Henrys Cat (1983-93). In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992. He is survived by their son, Simon, and two daughters, Rachel and Julia. Anthony Hayward Jeremy Swan writes: Monica Sims was a hard act to follow as head of BBC childrens programmes. But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.

Edward Barness greatest innovation, before he became head of BBC television childrens programmes from 1978 until 1986, lay in creating Newsround. He launched the news programme for young viewers in 1972, after discovering that only 0.7% of his target age group watched TV news: It was a man in a suit, talking, and it was boring, he said. He put John Craven, dressed casually in a sweater, in the presenters chair, initially for a six-week experiment, and the programme went on to become a BBC institution, even breaking major international news stories such as the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Barnes, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, also made a significant, long-lasting contribution as one of those who might be described as a godparent to Blue Peter, which was launched in 1958. He was an occasional floor manager during the shows first four years as it sailed choppy waters with the departure of two presenters and its original producer. Caretaker producers tried to steady the ship while the search went on for a permanent replacement in 1962. Barnes, then working on other BBC programmes as a production assistant, was turned down for the role. Biddy Baxter, who landed the job, had to serve three months notice in her BBC radio producers job, and fought off a suggestion that Barnes should produce Blue Peter until her arrival, concerned that he would not want to give way to a girl from radio. Instead, Leonard Chase assumed the temporary role, with Barnes assisting him, and hired Valerie Singleton to present alongside Christopher Trace. When Baxter took over, Barnes continued as assistant producer and directed the programme. His and Baxters wariness of each other evaporated and together  with Rosemary Gill as researcher  they moulded Blue Peter into a programme that became essential viewing for children. Baxter saw the involvement of viewers as the key to this, introducing makes  items created out of household materials  and annual appeals, and encouraging children to write in with ideas and stories by rewarding them with the famous Blue Peter badge. Barnes thought the programme should have its own distinctive logo, so Tony Hart was commissioned to design the galleon emblem, which featured on the badge. The idea of having a Blue Peter pet came from Barness wife, Dorothy, who scripted picture stories and other items for the show. Unfortunately, the mongrel chosen and introduced to viewers just before Christmas 1962 died of distemper two days later. Well have to get a substitute, said Barnes. The puppys only been seen once.

In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992. He is survived by their son, Simon, and two daughters, Rachel and Julia. Anthony Hayward Jeremy Swan writes: Monica Sims was a hard act to follow as head of BBC childrens programmes. But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.

Edward Barness greatest innovation, before he became head of BBC television childrens programmes from 1978 until 1986, lay in creating Newsround. He launched the news programme for young viewers in 1972, after discovering that only 0.7% of his target age group watched TV news: It was a man in a suit, talking, and it was boring, he said. He put John Craven, dressed casually in a sweater, in the presenters chair, initially for a six-week experiment, and the programme went on to become a BBC institution, even breaking major international news stories such as the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Barnes, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, also made a significant, long-lasting contribution as one of those who might be described as a godparent to Blue Peter, which was launched in 1958. He was an occasional floor manager during the shows first four years as it sailed choppy waters with the departure of two presenters and its original producer. Caretaker producers tried to steady the ship while the search went on for a permanent replacement in 1962. Barnes, then working on other BBC programmes as a production assistant, was turned down for the role. Biddy Baxter, who landed the job, had to serve three months notice in her BBC radio producers job, and fought off a suggestion that Barnes should produce Blue Peter until her arrival, concerned that he would not want to give way to a girl from radio. Instead, Leonard Chase assumed the temporary role, with Barnes assisting him, and hired Valerie Singleton to present alongside Christopher Trace. When Baxter took over, Barnes continued as assistant producer and directed the programme. His and Baxters wariness of each other evaporated and together  with Rosemary Gill as researcher  they moulded Blue Peter into a programme that became essential viewing for children. Baxter saw the involvement of viewers as the key to this, introducing makes  items created out of household materials  and annual appeals, and encouraging children to write in with ideas and stories by rewarding them with the famous Blue Peter badge. Barnes thought the programme should have its own distinctive logo, so Tony Hart was commissioned to design the galleon emblem, which featured on the badge. The idea of having a Blue Peter pet came from Barness wife, Dorothy, who scripted picture stories and other items for the show. Unfortunately, the mongrel chosen and introduced to viewers just before Christmas 1962 died of distemper two days later. Well have to get a substitute, said Barnes. The puppys only been seen once. Theres no point in upsetting children needlessly. In freezing snow, he and Baxter drove around London pet shops in his Mini and found a lookalike in Lewisham. Viewers voted to name her Petra, the female form of Peter, and she became the first in a long line of Blue Peter pets. In 1964, the show increased from one to two episodes a week and added John Noakes alongside Trace and Singleton. The following year, when Baxter was made the shows editor  a new title  Barnes and Gill became producers. Barnes was a great defender of his boss, who held an authoritarian grip on the show. He insisted that if, in her quest for perfection, she was ruthless, it was on behalf of the audience. Together, they also staged a fightback when, in 1964, BBC televisions childrens department lost its autonomy, and a new family department was formed out of childrens and womens programmes. We felt betrayed by the BBC, said Barnes, and we thought, Well show them. We wanted to give the management a black eye. Blue Peter and Play School were at the forefront of the battle and the childrens department was restored three years later. Maintaining his association with the show after leaving to become the BBCs assistant head of childrens programmes (1970-78), Barnes produced Blue Peter Royal Safari (1971), with Singleton accompanying Princess Anne on a tour of Kenyan wildlife parks. He also created and produced Blue Peter Special Assignment (1973-81), featuring trips to cities, islands, houses and rivers, initially as a vehicle for Singleton after she left the programme. As deputy to Monica Sims, he created Record Breakers (1972-2001) and Go With Noakes (1976-80) and ruffled some establishment feathers by commissioning Grange Hill (1978-2008), the soap producer Phil Redmonds warts-and-all drama about life in a comprehensive school.

But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.

Edward Barness greatest innovation, before he became head of BBC television childrens programmes from 1978 until 1986, lay in creating Newsround. He launched the news programme for young viewers in 1972, after discovering that only 0.7% of his target age group watched TV news: It was a man in a suit, talking, and it was boring, he said. He put John Craven, dressed casually in a sweater, in the presenters chair, initially for a six-week experiment, and the programme went on to become a BBC institution, even breaking major international news stories such as the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Barnes, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, also made a significant, long-lasting contribution as one of those who might be described as a godparent to Blue Peter, which was launched in 1958. He was an occasional floor manager during the shows first four years as it sailed choppy waters with the departure of two presenters and its original producer. Caretaker producers tried to steady the ship while the search went on for a permanent replacement in 1962. Barnes, then working on other BBC programmes as a production assistant, was turned down for the role. Biddy Baxter, who landed the job, had to serve three months notice in her BBC radio producers job, and fought off a suggestion that Barnes should produce Blue Peter until her arrival, concerned that he would not want to give way to a girl from radio. Instead, Leonard Chase assumed the temporary role, with Barnes assisting him, and hired Valerie Singleton to present alongside Christopher Trace. When Baxter took over, Barnes continued as assistant producer and directed the programme. His and Baxters wariness of each other evaporated and together  with Rosemary Gill as researcher  they moulded Blue Peter into a programme that became essential viewing for children. Baxter saw the involvement of viewers as the key to this, introducing makes  items created out of household materials  and annual appeals, and encouraging children to write in with ideas and stories by rewarding them with the famous Blue Peter badge. Barnes thought the programme should have its own distinctive logo, so Tony Hart was commissioned to design the galleon emblem, which featured on the badge. The idea of having a Blue Peter pet came from Barness wife, Dorothy, who scripted picture stories and other items for the show. Unfortunately, the mongrel chosen and introduced to viewers just before Christmas 1962 died of distemper two days later. Well have to get a substitute, said Barnes. The puppys only been seen once. Theres no point in upsetting children needlessly. In freezing snow, he and Baxter drove around London pet shops in his Mini and found a lookalike in Lewisham. Viewers voted to name her Petra, the female form of Peter, and she became the first in a long line of Blue Peter pets. In 1964, the show increased from one to two episodes a week and added John Noakes alongside Trace and Singleton. The following year, when Baxter was made the shows editor  a new title  Barnes and Gill became producers. Barnes was a great defender of his boss, who held an authoritarian grip on the show. He insisted that if, in her quest for perfection, she was ruthless, it was on behalf of the audience. Together, they also staged a fightback when, in 1964, BBC televisions childrens department lost its autonomy, and a new family department was formed out of childrens and womens programmes. We felt betrayed by the BBC, said Barnes, and we thought, Well show them. We wanted to give the management a black eye. Blue Peter and Play School were at the forefront of the battle and the childrens department was restored three years later. Maintaining his association with the show after leaving to become the BBCs assistant head of childrens programmes (1970-78), Barnes produced Blue Peter Royal Safari (1971), with Singleton accompanying Princess Anne on a tour of Kenyan wildlife parks. He also created and produced Blue Peter Special Assignment (1973-81), featuring trips to cities, islands, houses and rivers, initially as a vehicle for Singleton after she left the programme. As deputy to Monica Sims, he created Record Breakers (1972-2001) and Go With Noakes (1976-80) and ruffled some establishment feathers by commissioning Grange Hill (1978-2008), the soap producer Phil Redmonds warts-and-all drama about life in a comprehensive school. Other shows he oversaw or commissioned after taking over from Sims in 1978 included Rentaghost (1976-84), Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82), Think Again (1981-85), with Johnny Ball, Grandad (1979-84), starring Clive Dunn, Postman Pat (1981-96) and Henrys Cat (1983-93). In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992.

He launched the news programme for young viewers in 1972, after discovering that only 0.7% of his target age group watched TV news: It was a man in a suit, talking, and it was boring, he said. He put John Craven, dressed casually in a sweater, in the presenters chair, initially for a six-week experiment, and the programme went on to become a BBC institution, even breaking major international news stories such as the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Barnes, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, also made a significant, long-lasting contribution as one of those who might be described as a godparent to Blue Peter, which was launched in 1958. He was an occasional floor manager during the shows first four years as it sailed choppy waters with the departure of two presenters and its original producer. Caretaker producers tried to steady the ship while the search went on for a permanent replacement in 1962. Barnes, then working on other BBC programmes as a production assistant, was turned down for the role. Biddy Baxter, who landed the job, had to serve three months notice in her BBC radio producers job, and fought off a suggestion that Barnes should produce Blue Peter until her arrival, concerned that he would not want to give way to a girl from radio. Instead, Leonard Chase assumed the temporary role, with Barnes assisting him, and hired Valerie Singleton to present alongside Christopher Trace. When Baxter took over, Barnes continued as assistant producer and directed the programme. His and Baxters wariness of each other evaporated and together  with Rosemary Gill as researcher  they moulded Blue Peter into a programme that became essential viewing for children. Baxter saw the involvement of viewers as the key to this, introducing makes  items created out of household materials  and annual appeals, and encouraging children to write in with ideas and stories by rewarding them with the famous Blue Peter badge. Barnes thought the programme should have its own distinctive logo, so Tony Hart was commissioned to design the galleon emblem, which featured on the badge. The idea of having a Blue Peter pet came from Barness wife, Dorothy, who scripted picture stories and other items for the show. Unfortunately, the mongrel chosen and introduced to viewers just before Christmas 1962 died of distemper two days later. Well have to get a substitute, said Barnes. The puppys only been seen once. Theres no point in upsetting children needlessly. In freezing snow, he and Baxter drove around London pet shops in his Mini and found a lookalike in Lewisham. Viewers voted to name her Petra, the female form of Peter, and she became the first in a long line of Blue Peter pets. In 1964, the show increased from one to two episodes a week and added John Noakes alongside Trace and Singleton. The following year, when Baxter was made the shows editor  a new title  Barnes and Gill became producers. Barnes was a great defender of his boss, who held an authoritarian grip on the show. He insisted that if, in her quest for perfection, she was ruthless, it was on behalf of the audience. Together, they also staged a fightback when, in 1964, BBC televisions childrens department lost its autonomy, and a new family department was formed out of childrens and womens programmes. We felt betrayed by the BBC, said Barnes, and we thought, Well show them. We wanted to give the management a black eye. Blue Peter and Play School were at the forefront of the battle and the childrens department was restored three years later. Maintaining his association with the show after leaving to become the BBCs assistant head of childrens programmes (1970-78), Barnes produced Blue Peter Royal Safari (1971), with Singleton accompanying Princess Anne on a tour of Kenyan wildlife parks. He also created and produced Blue Peter Special Assignment (1973-81), featuring trips to cities, islands, houses and rivers, initially as a vehicle for Singleton after she left the programme. As deputy to Monica Sims, he created Record Breakers (1972-2001) and Go With Noakes (1976-80) and ruffled some establishment feathers by commissioning Grange Hill (1978-2008), the soap producer Phil Redmonds warts-and-all drama about life in a comprehensive school. Other shows he oversaw or commissioned after taking over from Sims in 1978 included Rentaghost (1976-84), Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82), Think Again (1981-85), with Johnny Ball, Grandad (1979-84), starring Clive Dunn, Postman Pat (1981-96) and Henrys Cat (1983-93). In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992. He is survived by their son, Simon, and two daughters, Rachel and Julia. Anthony Hayward Jeremy Swan writes: Monica Sims was a hard act to follow as head of BBC childrens programmes. But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.

Unfortunately, the mongrel chosen and introduced to viewers just before Christmas 1962 died of distemper two days later. Well have to get a substitute, said Barnes. The puppys only been seen once. Theres no point in upsetting children needlessly. In freezing snow, he and Baxter drove around London pet shops in his Mini and found a lookalike in Lewisham. Viewers voted to name her Petra, the female form of Peter, and she became the first in a long line of Blue Peter pets. In 1964, the show increased from one to two episodes a week and added John Noakes alongside Trace and Singleton. The following year, when Baxter was made the shows editor  a new title  Barnes and Gill became producers. Barnes was a great defender of his boss, who held an authoritarian grip on the show. He insisted that if, in her quest for perfection, she was ruthless, it was on behalf of the audience. Together, they also staged a fightback when, in 1964, BBC televisions childrens department lost its autonomy, and a new family department was formed out of childrens and womens programmes. We felt betrayed by the BBC, said Barnes, and we thought, Well show them. We wanted to give the management a black eye. Blue Peter and Play School were at the forefront of the battle and the childrens department was restored three years later. Maintaining his association with the show after leaving to become the BBCs assistant head of childrens programmes (1970-78), Barnes produced Blue Peter Royal Safari (1971), with Singleton accompanying Princess Anne on a tour of Kenyan wildlife parks. He also created and produced Blue Peter Special Assignment (1973-81), featuring trips to cities, islands, houses and rivers, initially as a vehicle for Singleton after she left the programme. As deputy to Monica Sims, he created Record Breakers (1972-2001) and Go With Noakes (1976-80) and ruffled some establishment feathers by commissioning Grange Hill (1978-2008), the soap producer Phil Redmonds warts-and-all drama about life in a comprehensive school. Other shows he oversaw or commissioned after taking over from Sims in 1978 included Rentaghost (1976-84), Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82), Think Again (1981-85), with Johnny Ball, Grandad (1979-84), starring Clive Dunn, Postman Pat (1981-96) and Henrys Cat (1983-93). In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992. He is survived by their son, Simon, and two daughters, Rachel and Julia. Anthony Hayward Jeremy Swan writes: Monica Sims was a hard act to follow as head of BBC childrens programmes. But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.

Edward Barness greatest innovation, before he became head of BBC television childrens programmes from 1978 until 1986, lay in creating Newsround. He launched the news programme for young viewers in 1972, after discovering that only 0.7% of his target age group watched TV news: It was a man in a suit, talking, and it was boring, he said. He put John Craven, dressed casually in a sweater, in the presenters chair, initially for a six-week experiment, and the programme went on to become a BBC institution, even breaking major international news stories such as the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Barnes, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, also made a significant, long-lasting contribution as one of those who might be described as a godparent to Blue Peter, which was launched in 1958. He was an occasional floor manager during the shows first four years as it sailed choppy waters with the departure of two presenters and its original producer. Caretaker producers tried to steady the ship while the search went on for a permanent replacement in 1962. Barnes, then working on other BBC programmes as a production assistant, was turned down for the role. Biddy Baxter, who landed the job, had to serve three months notice in her BBC radio producers job, and fought off a suggestion that Barnes should produce Blue Peter until her arrival, concerned that he would not want to give way to a girl from radio. Instead, Leonard Chase assumed the temporary role, with Barnes assisting him, and hired Valerie Singleton to present alongside Christopher Trace. When Baxter took over, Barnes continued as assistant producer and directed the programme. His and Baxters wariness of each other evaporated and together  with Rosemary Gill as researcher  they moulded Blue Peter into a programme that became essential viewing for children. Baxter saw the involvement of viewers as the key to this, introducing makes  items created out of household materials  and annual appeals, and encouraging children to write in with ideas and stories by rewarding them with the famous Blue Peter badge.

Other shows he oversaw or commissioned after taking over from Sims in 1978 included Rentaghost (1976-84), Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82), Think Again (1981-85), with Johnny Ball, Grandad (1979-84), starring Clive Dunn, Postman Pat (1981-96) and Henrys Cat (1983-93). In 1985, after Grange Hill had covered such issues as bullying, pregnancy and shoplifting, he endorsed a storyline about a pupil addicted to heroin, saying: We have a responsibility to our audience to warn them about the danger of hard drugs. Barnes also negotiated the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-90). He was born in Wigan, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), to Mabel (nee Latham), a nurse and midwife, and Hubert Barnes, the music critic of the Wigan Observer and an amateur actor. He left school at 14 and, after acting in repertory theatre, he was an announcer with the British Forces Network in Vienna (1946-49), then a stage manager in theatres, still acting occasionally. He appeared on BBC television in The Passing Show: Our Marie (1953), a biopic of the music-hall star Marie Lloyd, and played Melchior in Away in a Manger, a 1954 childrens nativity. He then joined the BBC as an assistant floor manager in 1955, when he also briefly presented the Light Programme radio show Housewives Choice. Following his early retirement in 1986, Barnes returned to programme-making, producing Treasure Houses (1987) and directing All Our Children (1990). He and Baxter wrote the book Blue Peter: The Inside Story, published in 1989. Dorothy (nee Smith), whom Barnes married in 1950, died in 1992. He is survived by their son, Simon, and two daughters, Rachel and Julia. Anthony Hayward Jeremy Swan writes: Monica Sims was a hard act to follow as head of BBC childrens programmes. But Edward Barnes was more than capable  his early years as the stage manager at the Pigalle Club in London had prepared him for anything. Heads of departments in television had to be great encouragers; they were continually nurturing the creative talents of workers whose temperaments were often eccentric. Edward was an excellent head of childrens programmes. He instigated and encouraged shows that he knew would be good for the audience and he administrated with wisdom and humour. His office in BBC Television Centres East Tower was dominated by a large palm tree and a big poster for the Penang railway. He was very attached to the far east. His home life was as creative as his job. His wife, Dorothy, was a writer and his children were talented in journalistic and literary fields. Edward effected a cheerful Mephistophelean appearance  his beard, fedora hats and flowing scarves all adding to his impresario persona. He relinquished his post in 1986 and was succeeded by Anna Home, for whom he worked as a producer, a role he filled with panache and gusto.  Herbert Edward Campbell Barnes, television executive and producer, born 8 October 1928; died 7 September 2021

Harry Kane is determined to shine a light on human rights abuses in Qatar with the help of captains from other national teams after expressing misgivings at the Gulf state hosting the World Cup this year. The England captain mentioned his Tottenham teammates Hugo Lloris and Son Heung-min  who captain France and South Korea respectively  and former clubmates such as Gareth Bale  the captain of Wales, who are hoping to qualify  as he looked to rally strength in numbers to drive lasting social change. Kane and his England teammates were briefed at St Georges Park on Tuesday about the issues surrounding Qatars hosting of the finals tournament  chiefly the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, led the conversation, with input from other Football Association members of staff, including Mark Bullingham, the chief executive, and Edleen John, the director of international relations, corporate affairs and co-partner for equality, diversity and inclusion. Southgate and Bullingham will travel to Qatar for the World Cup draw on Friday week and the FA is considering whether to give migrant workers a voice as part of any England media activity there. Kane said: Theres a couple of other national captains at Tottenham or maybe its talking to other national team captains to see if we can be unified, what we try and do. We havent spoken about it yet but, over the next weeks and months, its definitely a conversation we should have because when you are together as nations and you have that unity in terms of captains, you can send a message. It is something I will try to do. I think that will send out a bigger and more powerful message. It is part of the responsibility of a captain. It is important to talk about these things and not just hide away from them. And I know for sure the other lads will be happy to be talking about it, too. Hopefully we can make a real impact. Kane was asked whether it was right that the World Cup finals tournament had gone to Qatar. Its a hard question to answer, if I am totally honest, he said. It wasnt our decision, it was the decision of Fifa. The World Cup is one of the greatest tournaments I have ever played in. There is definitely that excitement of being there and experiencing that again  2018 was incredible for me and the other players involved. But there are some issues that you cant hide away from. There are, of course, some conflicting emotions around it. For me and our team its about controlling what we can control and thats to make sure we do what we can and use our platforms to help in any way we can. But also still be excited about a major tournament. We will have to learn to cope with it and balance the two. Kane admitted that in terms of gestures the England squad were unclear, as yet, about what they may do. Some national teams in Europe have worn T-shirts and displayed banners that have drawn attention to the human rights issues in Qatar. What Kane did say he wanted to see was action that led to change which went far beyond the four weeks of the tournament. Any issues that we are trying to resolve are trying to be resolved forever, Kane said. It is not just a quick fix. The fact there is a light shining on Qatar will help the situation and help us talk about it. Having these conversations now is definitely useful. But it is important those conversations carry on. It is similar to taking the knee [in the fight against racism]. It is not just something we did for a small amount of time. By carrying on, we keep showing our support and that has been really important. I think the same thing will happen in Qatar and, after the tournament, it will be important to keep talking about the issues and make sure anything we do help or improve is for the rest of time, not just a few months. England are preparing for Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast on Saturday and next Tuesday. Bukayo Saka did not train on Wednesday because of illness, although he is not believed to be Covidpositive. The goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has withdrawn and is likely to be replaced by Fraser Forster.

Harry Kane is determined to shine a light on human rights abuses in Qatar with the help of captains from other national teams after expressing misgivings at the Gulf state hosting the World Cup this year. The England captain mentioned his Tottenham teammates Hugo Lloris and Son Heung-min  who captain France and South Korea respectively  and former clubmates such as Gareth Bale  the captain of Wales, who are hoping to qualify  as he looked to rally strength in numbers to drive lasting social change. Kane and his England teammates were briefed at St Georges Park on Tuesday about the issues surrounding Qatars hosting of the finals tournament  chiefly the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, led the conversation, with input from other Football Association members of staff, including Mark Bullingham, the chief executive, and Edleen John, the director of international relations, corporate affairs and co-partner for equality, diversity and inclusion. Southgate and Bullingham will travel to Qatar for the World Cup draw on Friday week and the FA is considering whether to give migrant workers a voice as part of any England media activity there. Kane said: Theres a couple of other national captains at Tottenham or maybe its talking to other national team captains to see if we can be unified, what we try and do. We havent spoken about it yet but, over the next weeks and months, its definitely a conversation we should have because when you are together as nations and you have that unity in terms of captains, you can send a message. It is something I will try to do. I think that will send out a bigger and more powerful message. It is part of the responsibility of a captain. It is important to talk about these things and not just hide away from them. And I know for sure the other lads will be happy to be talking about it, too. Hopefully we can make a real impact. Kane was asked whether it was right that the World Cup finals tournament had gone to Qatar. Its a hard question to answer, if I am totally honest, he said. It wasnt our decision, it was the decision of Fifa. The World Cup is one of the greatest tournaments I have ever played in. There is definitely that excitement of being there and experiencing that again  2018 was incredible for me and the other players involved. But there are some issues that you cant hide away from. There are, of course, some conflicting emotions around it. For me and our team its about controlling what we can control and thats to make sure we do what we can and use our platforms to help in any way we can. But also still be excited about a major tournament. We will have to learn to cope with it and balance the two. Kane admitted that in terms of gestures the England squad were unclear, as yet, about what they may do. Some national teams in Europe have worn T-shirts and displayed banners that have drawn attention to the human rights issues in Qatar. What Kane did say he wanted to see was action that led to change which went far beyond the four weeks of the tournament. Any issues that we are trying to resolve are trying to be resolved forever, Kane said. It is not just a quick fix. The fact there is a light shining on Qatar will help the situation and help us talk about it. Having these conversations now is definitely useful. But it is important those conversations carry on. It is similar to taking the knee [in the fight against racism]. It is not just something we did for a small amount of time. By carrying on, we keep showing our support and that has been really important. I think the same thing will happen in Qatar and, after the tournament, it will be important to keep talking about the issues and make sure anything we do help or improve is for the rest of time, not just a few months.

The women in Patrick Demarcheliers photographs seem to be leading their best lives. Celebrities, stars, supermodels, his royal client Diana, Princess of Wales, are often caught in those moments of easeful perfection after hair and makeup prep is over, when they have been slathered with flattery, are camera-ready, but not yet self-conscious before the lens. The session has not passed from fun to work. Sitters described him as charming, always complimenting them with the never-lost strong French accent (his impenetrable Frenglish had to be subtitled for a fashion documentary). Demarchelier, who has died aged 78, came to fashion in Paris in the late 1960s, among a group of young photographers sharing a new informality. They preferred street snaps to studio shots, and unexotic young models sans sulks, visibly having a good time in places magazine readers could understand  a sunny beach, a market. The women also interacted with each other, whereas from the 40s to the mid-60s a model was usually isolated, alone on a page. Demarchelier did not pursue his confreres full reportage style, but transposed their lucky paparazzi catching a spontaneous moment quality over to portraits of the beautiful famous: he believed the perfect picture was a half-second accident. To catch it he worked pretty fast, especially in the era of small crews up to the late 90s, and could always be relied on to deliver a sellable cover to the newsstand. When the editor of US Vogue in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada checks he has been booked, everybody understands that she means: I want this tricky job with a diva delivered now, with no drama. William Blakes Damn braces, bless relaxes was the principle of his best covers. He took a few desultory frames of the teenage Christy Turlington lolling mussed after a day of many outfit changes in a Mexican resort, and voil, a great cover, Vogue 1989. The same year, he popped his young son Victor inside the huge towelling robe that Vanessa Duve was wearing on a beach, and caught them wind-ruffled and laughing together, another cover. Diana saw and liked it so much, the boy close in age to her sons, that she asked Demarchelier for a private portrait session. He brought in the stylist Sam McKnight to chop-snip her hair like model Linda Evangelistas, albeit with a tiara atop, and reassured unconfident Diana of her glamour; both were rewarded with memorable images that used supermodel visual language. Twenty years before, Norman Parkinson had produced a fine Vogue cover of Princess Anne in romantic fashions in the tradition of her royal mother and grandmother, but the Demarchelier-Diana collaboration was novel; it helped establish Diana as a celebrity independent of the Windsor family firm. Her friend, then UK Vogue editor, Liz Tilberis, requested Palace permission to reproduce one picture as a cover, and commissioned fresh sequences. Demarchelier was anything but to a high style born, one of five sons of a half-French, half-English mother and a father frequently away with a travelling cinema, who then left permanently for Africa. The family crowded in with relatives in industrial Le Havre, Normandy, and the boy was a layabout at school, always taking pictures with his eyes, in brilliant light (his oeuvre, indoors and out, is brightly lit). His mother divorced and remarried, and when he was 17 his stepfather gave him a simple Kodak, with which he did portraits and wedding shots for small fees, finding a job as a lab retoucher and printer of passport pictures. His sole aim was to make it to Paris, which he did at 20, earning a living as a printer of news pictures. Demarchelier became house photographer to a Paris model agency, then assistant to Hans Feurer, already shooting in the new mode, ready-to-wear clothes on non-soigne models, for the lively young magazines Elle, Marie Claire and Nova. Feurer saw clothes first, Demarchelier regarded every assignment as a portrait-of-a-character job, leaving the garments to the choice and arrangement of the fashion editor and stylists; even in his mighty Rizzoli book, Dior Couture (2011), the models triumph over their fabulous garb. That approach paid off slowly: Cond Nasts editorial director Alex Lieberman recruited him to the magazine empire in the 70s, but his success really grew in the 80s, when movie and music business stars, and supermodels who became celebrities themselves, brought their names and huge personalities into editorial and ad pictures. Demarcheliers contract allowed him to do both kinds of work, including ad campaigns for Dior, Chanel, Armani and Ralph Lauren, and that privilege continued when in 1992 Tilberis moved to the Hearst Corporation in New York, to edit Harpers, and demanded as part of her deal that Hearst pay the high price of appointing Demarchelier as lead photographer. The corporation got good value as he also provided covers and editorial for Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Oprah Winfreys magazine O, and Esquire. Cond Nast had to offer him seven figures to return in 2004, by when his Manhattan studio had expanded to three floors and a long pay-roll, although he remained nostalgic for his NY beginnings in 1974, just him and the cameras, managing his own lights. Despite some starry male portraits, this big equipage all depended on Demarcheliers relationship with female subjects, including most of the Oscar red-carpet A-list plus Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Cline Dion and Janet Jackson, whom he shot discreetly topless for Rolling Stone. Demarchelier said he did not like women who were exhibitionists, but over the decades his frank delight in close proximity to women persuaded many sitters into at least a flash of cleavage and sometimes nudity. Then in 2018 a Boston Globe investigation reported that this much-professed rapport had been predatory over the years, with seven women, including an assistant, alleging unwanted advances by Demarchelier. He denied the accusations, but Cond Nast immediately announced that he would not work for it again. He met Mia Skoog when she was modelling on a Vogue shoot, and they married early on in his career with the magazine. She and their sons, Gustaf, Arthur and Victor, survive him.  Patrick Demarchelier, photographer, born 21 August 1943; died 31 March 2022 A selection of Demarcheliers work is displayed here.

William Blakes Damn braces, bless relaxes was the principle of his best covers. He took a few desultory frames of the teenage Christy Turlington lolling mussed after a day of many outfit changes in a Mexican resort, and voil, a great cover, Vogue 1989. The same year, he popped his young son Victor inside the huge towelling robe that Vanessa Duve was wearing on a beach, and caught them wind-ruffled and laughing together, another cover. Diana saw and liked it so much, the boy close in age to her sons, that she asked Demarchelier for a private portrait session. He brought in the stylist Sam McKnight to chop-snip her hair like model Linda Evangelistas, albeit with a tiara atop, and reassured unconfident Diana of her glamour; both were rewarded with memorable images that used supermodel visual language. Twenty years before, Norman Parkinson had produced a fine Vogue cover of Princess Anne in romantic fashions in the tradition of her royal mother and grandmother, but the Demarchelier-Diana collaboration was novel; it helped establish Diana as a celebrity independent of the Windsor family firm. Her friend, then UK Vogue editor, Liz Tilberis, requested Palace permission to reproduce one picture as a cover, and commissioned fresh sequences. Demarchelier was anything but to a high style born, one of five sons of a half-French, half-English mother and a father frequently away with a travelling cinema, who then left permanently for Africa. The family crowded in with relatives in industrial Le Havre, Normandy, and the boy was a layabout at school, always taking pictures with his eyes, in brilliant light (his oeuvre, indoors and out, is brightly lit). His mother divorced and remarried, and when he was 17 his stepfather gave him a simple Kodak, with which he did portraits and wedding shots for small fees, finding a job as a lab retoucher and printer of passport pictures. His sole aim was to make it to Paris, which he did at 20, earning a living as a printer of news pictures. Demarchelier became house photographer to a Paris model agency, then assistant to Hans Feurer, already shooting in the new mode, ready-to-wear clothes on non-soigne models, for the lively young magazines Elle, Marie Claire and Nova. Feurer saw clothes first, Demarchelier regarded every assignment as a portrait-of-a-character job, leaving the garments to the choice and arrangement of the fashion editor and stylists; even in his mighty Rizzoli book, Dior Couture (2011), the models triumph over their fabulous garb. That approach paid off slowly: Cond Nasts editorial director Alex Lieberman recruited him to the magazine empire in the 70s, but his success really grew in the 80s, when movie and music business stars, and supermodels who became celebrities themselves, brought their names and huge personalities into editorial and ad pictures. Demarcheliers contract allowed him to do both kinds of work, including ad campaigns for Dior, Chanel, Armani and Ralph Lauren, and that privilege continued when in 1992 Tilberis moved to the Hearst Corporation in New York, to edit Harpers, and demanded as part of her deal that Hearst pay the high price of appointing Demarchelier as lead photographer. The corporation got good value as he also provided covers and editorial for Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Oprah Winfreys magazine O, and Esquire. Cond Nast had to offer him seven figures to return in 2004, by when his Manhattan studio had expanded to three floors and a long pay-roll, although he remained nostalgic for his NY beginnings in 1974, just him and the cameras, managing his own lights. Despite some starry male portraits, this big equipage all depended on Demarcheliers relationship with female subjects, including most of the Oscar red-carpet A-list plus Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Cline Dion and Janet Jackson, whom he shot discreetly topless for Rolling Stone. Demarchelier said he did not like women who were exhibitionists, but over the decades his frank delight in close proximity to women persuaded many sitters into at least a flash of cleavage and sometimes nudity. Then in 2018 a Boston Globe investigation reported that this much-professed rapport had been predatory over the years, with seven women, including an assistant, alleging unwanted advances by Demarchelier. He denied the accusations, but Cond Nast immediately announced that he would not work for it again. He met Mia Skoog when she was modelling on a Vogue shoot, and they married early on in his career with the magazine. She and their sons, Gustaf, Arthur and Victor, survive him.

The women in Patrick Demarcheliers photographs seem to be leading their best lives. Celebrities, stars, supermodels, his royal client Diana, Princess of Wales, are often caught in those moments of easeful perfection after hair and makeup prep is over, when they have been slathered with flattery, are camera-ready, but not yet self-conscious before the lens. The session has not passed from fun to work. Sitters described him as charming, always complimenting them with the never-lost strong French accent (his impenetrable Frenglish had to be subtitled for a fashion documentary). Demarchelier, who has died aged 78, came to fashion in Paris in the late 1960s, among a group of young photographers sharing a new informality. They preferred street snaps to studio shots, and unexotic young models sans sulks, visibly having a good time in places magazine readers could understand  a sunny beach, a market. The women also interacted with each other, whereas from the 40s to the mid-60s a model was usually isolated, alone on a page. Demarchelier did not pursue his confreres full reportage style, but transposed their lucky paparazzi catching a spontaneous moment quality over to portraits of the beautiful famous: he believed the perfect picture was a half-second accident. To catch it he worked pretty fast, especially in the era of small crews up to the late 90s, and could always be relied on to deliver a sellable cover to the newsstand. When the editor of US Vogue in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada checks he has been booked, everybody understands that she means: I want this tricky job with a diva delivered now, with no drama.

Steven Gerrard refused to blame a lengthy VAR call that led to an Aston Villa equaliser being ruled out for offside for his teams elimination from the FA Cup by Manchester United on Monday night, with the manager instead urging his team to flip the result when hosting them in the Premier League on Saturday. Villa lost the third-round tie at Old Trafford 1-0 having conceded Scott McTominays early header but then dominated throughout. United also rode their luck as Villa had two goals ruled out in the second half. The latter was a relatively straightforward offside call against Danny Ings, who had played in Ollie Watkins to poke home from close range. However, the first was more debatable and involved a delay of more than three minutes with VAR calling on the referee, Michael Oliver, to make a judgment after Ings had scored from close range. Oliver consulted the pitchside monitor and eventually ruled that Villas midfielder Jacob Ramsey was offside and had impeded Edinson Cavani in the build-up. The disappointment was that it took three and a half minutes to iron it out, said Gerrard. We had the momentum at the time and that three and a half minutes took a lot of the sting out of the game. But its not the reason we lost. We need to focus on other things, not just VAR going against us. The players have an opportunity to flip the mood, flip the feeling [on Saturday]  they have an opportunity at Villa Park to straighten that out. Gerrard also brushed off being taunted throughout the tie by the Old Trafford crowd for being a former captain of Liverpool. It was relatively quiet  I have been to noisier stadiums than this, he said.  It was a good Cup tie, a good atmosphere but in terms of what I got, water off a ducks back. Meanwhile Uniteds interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, defended Marcus Rashford, who performed poorly against Villa and has now gone 11 games without scoring, his worst run since the 2016-17 season. Hes trying hard, done well in training in the last couple of days, said the 63-year-old. In the first half we found him quite often - the second half not as often and so we decided to make changes with Anthony Elanga and Jesse Lingard [coming on for Rashford and Bruno Fernandes].

The disappointment was that it took three and a half minutes to iron it out, said Gerrard. We had the momentum at the time and that three and a half minutes took a lot of the sting out of the game. But its not the reason we lost. We need to focus on other things, not just VAR going against us. The players have an opportunity to flip the mood, flip the feeling [on Saturday]  they have an opportunity at Villa Park to straighten that out. Gerrard also brushed off being taunted throughout the tie by the Old Trafford crowd for being a former captain of Liverpool. It was relatively quiet  I have been to noisier stadiums than this, he said.  It was a good Cup tie, a good atmosphere but in terms of what I got, water off a ducks back. Meanwhile Uniteds interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, defended Marcus Rashford, who performed poorly against Villa and has now gone 11 games without scoring, his worst run since the 2016-17 season. Hes trying hard, done well in training in the last couple of days, said the 63-year-old. In the first half we found him quite often - the second half not as often and so we decided to make changes with Anthony Elanga and Jesse Lingard [coming on for Rashford and Bruno Fernandes].

Steven Gerrard refused to blame a lengthy VAR call that led to an Aston Villa equaliser being ruled out for offside for his teams elimination from the FA Cup by Manchester United on Monday night, with the manager instead urging his team to flip the result when hosting them in the Premier League on Saturday. Villa lost the third-round tie at Old Trafford 1-0 having conceded Scott McTominays early header but then dominated throughout. United also rode their luck as Villa had two goals ruled out in the second half.

However, the first was more debatable and involved a delay of more than three minutes with VAR calling on the referee, Michael Oliver, to make a judgment after Ings had scored from close range. Oliver consulted the pitchside monitor and eventually ruled that Villas midfielder Jacob Ramsey was offside and had impeded Edinson Cavani in the build-up. The disappointment was that it took three and a half minutes to iron it out, said Gerrard. We had the momentum at the time and that three and a half minutes took a lot of the sting out of the game. But its not the reason we lost. We need to focus on other things, not just VAR going against us. The players have an opportunity to flip the mood, flip the feeling [on Saturday]  they have an opportunity at Villa Park to straighten that out. Gerrard also brushed off being taunted throughout the tie by the Old Trafford crowd for being a former captain of Liverpool. It was relatively quiet  I have been to noisier stadiums than this, he said.  It was a good Cup tie, a good atmosphere but in terms of what I got, water off a ducks back. Meanwhile Uniteds interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, defended Marcus Rashford, who performed poorly against Villa and has now gone 11 games without scoring, his worst run since the 2016-17 season. Hes trying hard, done well in training in the last couple of days, said the 63-year-old. In the first half we found him quite often - the second half not as often and so we decided to make changes with Anthony Elanga and Jesse Lingard [coming on for Rashford and Bruno Fernandes].

In the 1960s the American psychiatrist Aaron Beck, who has died aged 100, created cognitive behavioural therapy. It came as a revelation, as it enabled some patients with anxiety or other mental health conditions to be treated in just 12 sessions without years of protracted psychoanalysis. Beck posited that people have automatic thoughts  deeply held assumptions colouring their mental state. He held that anxiety and other feelings stem from distorted thinking, but this can be challenged and transformed. To convince the psychiatry establishment, he ran a randomised controlled study in the 70s. This was the first of its kind, and showed cognitive behavioural therapy beating the leading drug in helping people with depression. In 1994, with his psychologist daughter, Judith, Beck set up the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia to train and mentor therapists and advance the technique. More than 2,000 studies have verified CBTs efficacy and it has branched out from its original use for depression and anxiety to treat addiction, eating disorders and many other mental health issues, as well as pain and even schizophrenia. It is used all over the world and is a mainstay of NHS mental health treatment. Becks theories grew out of dissatisfaction with the prevailing approach to psychological treatment in the 50s. He had trained as a psychoanalyst and followed the ideas of Sigmund Freud, who believed depression stemmed from repressed anger. However, Becks research into the dreams of depressed people  Freud considered dreams the royal road to the unconscious  found otherwise. Beck found one depressed mans dream, for example, that he was at a formal dance wearing two left shoes, revealed, far from being angry, he was as depressed and sad in his dreams as when awake. From 1954 Beck worked in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and would see patients for psychoanalysis. They would arrive week after week to lie on a couch and free associate  voice thoughts that randomly came into their head  as Freud believed mental disorders could be resolved by exploring long-buried memories. Beck became restive and sceptical about the role of the therapist: The idea was that if you sat back and listened and said Ah-ha, somehow their secrets would come out. In 1960 he had a momentous insight. He asked one of his psychoanalysis patients, who was talking about her sexual encounters, how she felt telling him this and was astonished when she said she felt anxious, as no doubt she was boring him. He discovered she thought she bored everybody, which made her feel anxious and led her to engage in racy exploits to appear more attractive. Beck found such automatic thoughts and low self-esteem were common, with many patients convinced they were unlovable or worthless, and these thoughts fuelled their depression or anxiety. So could their mood lift if you altered their thinking? A pragmatic man who enjoyed finding solutions, Beck abandoned the formal psychoanalytic approach and started to offer patients alternative ways of thinking, for example suggesting to a man who said he was unloved as his wife did not say goodbye when she left the house that there might be an alternative explanation. He encouraged his patients to monitor their thoughts, avoid over-generalising and to test their assumptions in homework (for example to see if they could manage a social occasion without drinking). Over the next decades therapists adapted the basic approach of cognitive behavioural therapy to suit different conditions from depression to panic attacks, eating disorders, insomnia, addiction and pain. In his 70-year career Beck wrote or co-wrote around 600 papers and 25 books, and developed classification systems to measure symptoms of specific disorders and to assess suicide risk. Working well into his 90s, his most recent project was recovery-orientated cognitive therapy to help people manage schizophrenia. Aaron Temkin Beck (known as Tim) was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest of three surviving children. His parents, Elizabeth (nee Temkin) and Harry Beck, a printer, were Russian-Jewish immigrants. At the age of eight he broke his arm and developed septicaemia, spending a month in hospital. From this time he became phobic about blood and injury, feeling anxious if he smelled ether. However, he learned to manage his anxiety by focusing his mind elsewhere and realised there was a connection between thoughts and feelings. After gaining an English degree (1942) at Brown University, Rhode Island, Beck studied medicine at Yale University. He originally chose to specialise in neurology, but changed tack to psychiatry and trained in psychoanalysis at the same time. After military service, in 1954 he joined the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he combined research with seeing patients. In 1992 he was made professor emeritus at the university and in 1994 set up his not-for-profit institute to train mental health professionals. He was awarded the Albert Lasker award (2006) in recognition of his work in shaping modern psychotherapy. In 1950 Beck married Phyllis Whitman, a lawyer who became the first female judge in the superior court of Pennsylvania, and the couple had four children. An avid tennis player, he played into his 80s. He is survived by Phyllis, their children, Roy, Judith, Daniel and Alice, 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.  Aaron Temkin Beck, psychiatrist, born 21 July 1921; died 1 November 2021

This was the first of its kind, and showed cognitive behavioural therapy beating the leading drug in helping people with depression. In 1994, with his psychologist daughter, Judith, Beck set up the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia to train and mentor therapists and advance the technique. More than 2,000 studies have verified CBTs efficacy and it has branched out from its original use for depression and anxiety to treat addiction, eating disorders and many other mental health issues, as well as pain and even schizophrenia. It is used all over the world and is a mainstay of NHS mental health treatment. Becks theories grew out of dissatisfaction with the prevailing approach to psychological treatment in the 50s. He had trained as a psychoanalyst and followed the ideas of Sigmund Freud, who believed depression stemmed from repressed anger. However, Becks research into the dreams of depressed people  Freud considered dreams the royal road to the unconscious  found otherwise. Beck found one depressed mans dream, for example, that he was at a formal dance wearing two left shoes, revealed, far from being angry, he was as depressed and sad in his dreams as when awake. From 1954 Beck worked in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and would see patients for psychoanalysis. They would arrive week after week to lie on a couch and free associate  voice thoughts that randomly came into their head  as Freud believed mental disorders could be resolved by exploring long-buried memories. Beck became restive and sceptical about the role of the therapist: The idea was that if you sat back and listened and said Ah-ha, somehow their secrets would come out. In 1960 he had a momentous insight. He asked one of his psychoanalysis patients, who was talking about her sexual encounters, how she felt telling him this and was astonished when she said she felt anxious, as no doubt she was boring him. He discovered she thought she bored everybody, which made her feel anxious and led her to engage in racy exploits to appear more attractive. Beck found such automatic thoughts and low self-esteem were common, with many patients convinced they were unlovable or worthless, and these thoughts fuelled their depression or anxiety. So could their mood lift if you altered their thinking? A pragmatic man who enjoyed finding solutions, Beck abandoned the formal psychoanalytic approach and started to offer patients alternative ways of thinking, for example suggesting to a man who said he was unloved as his wife did not say goodbye when she left the house that there might be an alternative explanation. He encouraged his patients to monitor their thoughts, avoid over-generalising and to test their assumptions in homework (for example to see if they could manage a social occasion without drinking). Over the next decades therapists adapted the basic approach of cognitive behavioural therapy to suit different conditions from depression to panic attacks, eating disorders, insomnia, addiction and pain. In his 70-year career Beck wrote or co-wrote around 600 papers and 25 books, and developed classification systems to measure symptoms of specific disorders and to assess suicide risk. Working well into his 90s, his most recent project was recovery-orientated cognitive therapy to help people manage schizophrenia. Aaron Temkin Beck (known as Tim) was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest of three surviving children. His parents, Elizabeth (nee Temkin) and Harry Beck, a printer, were Russian-Jewish immigrants. At the age of eight he broke his arm and developed septicaemia, spending a month in hospital. From this time he became phobic about blood and injury, feeling anxious if he smelled ether. However, he learned to manage his anxiety by focusing his mind elsewhere and realised there was a connection between thoughts and feelings. After gaining an English degree (1942) at Brown University, Rhode Island, Beck studied medicine at Yale University. He originally chose to specialise in neurology, but changed tack to psychiatry and trained in psychoanalysis at the same time. After military service, in 1954 he joined the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he combined research with seeing patients. In 1992 he was made professor emeritus at the university and in 1994 set up his not-for-profit institute to train mental health professionals. He was awarded the Albert Lasker award (2006) in recognition of his work in shaping modern psychotherapy. In 1950 Beck married Phyllis Whitman, a lawyer who became the first female judge in the superior court of Pennsylvania, and the couple had four children. An avid tennis player, he played into his 80s. He is survived by Phyllis, their children, Roy, Judith, Daniel and Alice, 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

It came as a revelation, as it enabled some patients with anxiety or other mental health conditions to be treated in just 12 sessions without years of protracted psychoanalysis. Beck posited that people have automatic thoughts  deeply held assumptions colouring their mental state. He held that anxiety and other feelings stem from distorted thinking, but this can be challenged and transformed. To convince the psychiatry establishment, he ran a randomised controlled study in the 70s. This was the first of its kind, and showed cognitive behavioural therapy beating the leading drug in helping people with depression. In 1994, with his psychologist daughter, Judith, Beck set up the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia to train and mentor therapists and advance the technique. More than 2,000 studies have verified CBTs efficacy and it has branched out from its original use for depression and anxiety to treat addiction, eating disorders and many other mental health issues, as well as pain and even schizophrenia. It is used all over the world and is a mainstay of NHS mental health treatment. Becks theories grew out of dissatisfaction with the prevailing approach to psychological treatment in the 50s. He had trained as a psychoanalyst and followed the ideas of Sigmund Freud, who believed depression stemmed from repressed anger. However, Becks research into the dreams of depressed people  Freud considered dreams the royal road to the unconscious  found otherwise. Beck found one depressed mans dream, for example, that he was at a formal dance wearing two left shoes, revealed, far from being angry, he was as depressed and sad in his dreams as when awake. From 1954 Beck worked in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and would see patients for psychoanalysis. They would arrive week after week to lie on a couch and free associate  voice thoughts that randomly came into their head  as Freud believed mental disorders could be resolved by exploring long-buried memories. Beck became restive and sceptical about the role of the therapist: The idea was that if you sat back and listened and said Ah-ha, somehow their secrets would come out. In 1960 he had a momentous insight. He asked one of his psychoanalysis patients, who was talking about her sexual encounters, how she felt telling him this and was astonished when she said she felt anxious, as no doubt she was boring him. He discovered she thought she bored everybody, which made her feel anxious and led her to engage in racy exploits to appear more attractive. Beck found such automatic thoughts and low self-esteem were common, with many patients convinced they were unlovable or worthless, and these thoughts fuelled their depression or anxiety. So could their mood lift if you altered their thinking? A pragmatic man who enjoyed finding solutions, Beck abandoned the formal psychoanalytic approach and started to offer patients alternative ways of thinking, for example suggesting to a man who said he was unloved as his wife did not say goodbye when she left the house that there might be an alternative explanation. He encouraged his patients to monitor their thoughts, avoid over-generalising and to test their assumptions in homework (for example to see if they could manage a social occasion without drinking). Over the next decades therapists adapted the basic approach of cognitive behavioural therapy to suit different conditions from depression to panic attacks, eating disorders, insomnia, addiction and pain. In his 70-year career Beck wrote or co-wrote around 600 papers and 25 books, and developed classification systems to measure symptoms of specific disorders and to assess suicide risk. Working well into his 90s, his most recent project was recovery-orientated cognitive therapy to help people manage schizophrenia. Aaron Temkin Beck (known as Tim) was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest of three surviving children. His parents, Elizabeth (nee Temkin) and Harry Beck, a printer, were Russian-Jewish immigrants. At the age of eight he broke his arm and developed septicaemia, spending a month in hospital. From this time he became phobic about blood and injury, feeling anxious if he smelled ether. However, he learned to manage his anxiety by focusing his mind elsewhere and realised there was a connection between thoughts and feelings. After gaining an English degree (1942) at Brown University, Rhode Island, Beck studied medicine at Yale University. He originally chose to specialise in neurology, but changed tack to psychiatry and trained in psychoanalysis at the same time. After military service, in 1954 he joined the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, where he combined research with seeing patients. In 1992 he was made professor emeritus at the university and in 1994 set up his not-for-profit institute to train mental health professionals. He was awarded the Albert Lasker award (2006) in recognition of his work in shaping modern psychotherapy. In 1950 Beck married Phyllis Whitman, a lawyer who became the first female judge in the superior court of Pennsylvania, and the couple had four children. An avid tennis player, he played into his 80s. He is survived by Phyllis, their children, Roy, Judith, Daniel and Alice, 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilsons numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilsons work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilsons work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.

With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilsons numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilsons work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilsons work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation.

He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilsons numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilsons work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilsons work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens.

He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.  Edward Osborne Wilson, biologist, naturalist and author, born 10 June 1929; died 26 December 2021

When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individuals genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the nature v nurture debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined human nature includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilsons numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilsons work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilsons work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists).

In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planets Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planets surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. Were extinguishing Earths biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin, he wrote. Have we no shame? Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should never back down if honour is at stake; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ants progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hlldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as just a flick on a movie screen, but, he added We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever. Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.  Edward Osborne Wilson, biologist, naturalist and author, born 10 June 1929; died 26 December 2021

In the period following the explosion begun by Marvel Comics in the 1960s and accelerated by the campy Batman TV series in the middle of the decade, Neal Adams, who has died aged 80 of complications from sepsis, was one of the greatest, and probably most influential, artists in comics. Adams was central to the rethinking of characters including Marvels X-Men and, for their rival DC Comics, the Spectre, Deadman and, most crucially, the Batman. He also brought about changes to business practices, most notably winning artists the right to their original artwork, and getting long-delayed credit and compensation in the 1980s for the Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. He reinvented the look of comic pages and characters, said the writer Neil Gaiman. He was the reason I drew Batman in every school exercise book. Adams combined the powerful dynamism and expressionist movement of early Marvels two masters, Jack Kirby (Fantastic Four, Captain America) and Steve Ditko (Spider Man, Doctor Strange). But his work, influenced by the limitations of four-panel daily comics and glossy ad work, also displayed the more romantic attractiveness usually offered by less dramatic artists. His characters could be as muscular as Frank Frazettas barbarians and as appealing as Alex Raymonds daily strips, but they soared through the panels, every movement telling the story  he was always cinematically aware of the viewers place outside the page. Adams knew early he wanted to draw comics. He was born on Governors Island, New York, where his father, Frank, was stationed with the US army. He grew up on bases, including in Germany, but his father was not heavily involved in his upbringing. His mother, Liliane, worked in a shoe factory and for the national phone company, and ran a boarding house. When his father left, Neal worked on the Coney Island boardwalk, near their home, to help support his mother. He went to the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan, leaving in 1959, and then sent his work to DC, who rejected it. When he took it to Archie Comics, the editor Joe Simon (co-creator of Captain America) told him not to ruin his life in the business. Nevertheless, Adams drew sample pages for Archies nascent superhero, the Fly, and some of the work was used. He was hired, but to draw comic fillers for Archies Joke Book. After this, he assisted Howard Nostrand, mostly drawing backgrounds on his daily newspaper strip, Bat Masterson, then worked in advertising before getting his own strip in 1962: Ben Casey  like Masterson based on a successful TV series. It ran until 1966. Though daily strips tended to soap opera, Casey, about a hospital surgeon, touched on contemporary issues. In 1967 he began drawing stories for Creepy and Eerie, black-and-white magazines emulating the 1950s EC horror comics. When DCs Joe Kubert began drawing the Tales of the Green Beret daily strip, Adams was hired to replace him on DCs war comics, yet soon found himself working on Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope comics. But his spectacular cover for The Brave and the Bold featuring Batman and the Spectre led to more work on superheroes, including a remarkable sequence on Deadman. Deadman had been co-created by Carmine Infantino, who was now DCs publisher. He called Adams his sparkplug. This may explain why Adams was one of the few people to freelance for DC and Marvel simultaneously. In 1969 he and the Marvel writer Roy Thomas tried to revive the failing X-Men book. Their run lasted only nine issues before cancellation, but they brought back Professor X, and when the series was revived in 1975 theirs was the template it followed. Adams, Thomas and the inker Tom Palmer brought The Avengers to new heights with the Kree-Skrull War series (1971-72). But his key partnership occurred back at DC, with the writer Dennis ONeil, with whom he had also worked at Marvel. They recaptured the Batman from the TV series camp Pow! Wham! characterisation, creating more realism and more menace, and helping bring the DC line back to relevance. Their new characters, especially the Fu Manchu-like villain Ras Al Ghul, who first appeared in 1971, and his femme fatale daughter Talia, and their recreation of the Joker in 1973 as a psychopathic killer, set the bar for future reinterpretations. They also redid the awkward pairing of Green Lantern and Green Arrow with a story arc including the discovery that the Arrows sidekick, Speedy, had become a junkie. Besides having contemporary resonance, it was arguably the first comic storyline to examine the now-familiar paradox of the inability of superheroes to actually change the world. Dissatisfied with both the artistic and economic strictures of comic books, Adams and the DC artist and editor Dick Giordano formed their own studio, Continuity Associates, in 1978. His final story for DC was one of his favourites, Superman Vs Muhammad Ali (1978), with its famous cover containing dozens of celebrities (and colleagues) at ringside. His company moved in new directions, primarily providing storyboards for movies, but also into animation, game design, computer graphics and advertising. Adams could be a hard teacher, but he was also a supportive resource, whose wide respect in the field opened doors for newcomers. The artists gathered around Continuity Associates also packaged comics for the big companies; they were known as Crusty Bunkers. One of the most famous Bunkers, Denys Cowan, called Adams his second dad. Adams himself illustrated books and worked for some new independent publishers. For years he battled the big companies to establish copyright for artists; in 1987 he won a court decision that denied copyright but compelled the return of original art. Along with the golden age artist Jerry Robinson and the lawyer Ed Priess, he won Siegel, Shuster and their families recognition and royalties from DC just as the Superman franchise was becoming huge. In 2005, he returned to comics, later writing and drawing the miniseries Batman: Odyssey (2010) for DC and The First X-Men (2013) for Marvel. In 2008, Adams worked with the David S Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, Washington, lobbying the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum to return Dina Babbitts original artwork, drawn to illustrate Dr Josef Mengeles racial theories in order to save herself and her daughter from the gas chambers. He illustrated, with Kubert, a six-page story about Babbitt, with a foreword by Stan Lee; two years later he illustrated and narrated a Disney series, They Spoke Out: American Voices Against the Holocaust. Adams is survived by his second wife, Marilyn, whom he married in 1987, and their son, Josh, and by his daughters, Kris and Zeea, and sons, Joel and Jason, from his first marriage, to Cory Adams, a comics colourist, which ended in divorce.  Neal Adams, artist, born 15 June 1941; died 28 April 2022

His mother, Liliane, worked in a shoe factory and for the national phone company, and ran a boarding house. When his father left, Neal worked on the Coney Island boardwalk, near their home, to help support his mother. He went to the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan, leaving in 1959, and then sent his work to DC, who rejected it. When he took it to Archie Comics, the editor Joe Simon (co-creator of Captain America) told him not to ruin his life in the business. Nevertheless, Adams drew sample pages for Archies nascent superhero, the Fly, and some of the work was used. He was hired, but to draw comic fillers for Archies Joke Book. After this, he assisted Howard Nostrand, mostly drawing backgrounds on his daily newspaper strip, Bat Masterson, then worked in advertising before getting his own strip in 1962: Ben Casey  like Masterson based on a successful TV series. It ran until 1966. Though daily strips tended to soap opera, Casey, about a hospital surgeon, touched on contemporary issues. In 1967 he began drawing stories for Creepy and Eerie, black-and-white magazines emulating the 1950s EC horror comics. When DCs Joe Kubert began drawing the Tales of the Green Beret daily strip, Adams was hired to replace him on DCs war comics, yet soon found himself working on Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope comics. But his spectacular cover for The Brave and the Bold featuring Batman and the Spectre led to more work on superheroes, including a remarkable sequence on Deadman. Deadman had been co-created by Carmine Infantino, who was now DCs publisher. He called Adams his sparkplug. This may explain why Adams was one of the few people to freelance for DC and Marvel simultaneously. In 1969 he and the Marvel writer Roy Thomas tried to revive the failing X-Men book. Their run lasted only nine issues before cancellation, but they brought back Professor X, and when the series was revived in 1975 theirs was the template it followed. Adams, Thomas and the inker Tom Palmer brought The Avengers to new heights with the Kree-Skrull War series (1971-72). But his key partnership occurred back at DC, with the writer Dennis ONeil, with whom he had also worked at Marvel. They recaptured the Batman from the TV series camp Pow! Wham! characterisation, creating more realism and more menace, and helping bring the DC line back to relevance. Their new characters, especially the Fu Manchu-like villain Ras Al Ghul, who first appeared in 1971, and his femme fatale daughter Talia, and their recreation of the Joker in 1973 as a psychopathic killer, set the bar for future reinterpretations. They also redid the awkward pairing of Green Lantern and Green Arrow with a story arc including the discovery that the Arrows sidekick, Speedy, had become a junkie. Besides having contemporary resonance, it was arguably the first comic storyline to examine the now-familiar paradox of the inability of superheroes to actually change the world. Dissatisfied with both the artistic and economic strictures of comic books, Adams and the DC artist and editor Dick Giordano formed their own studio, Continuity Associates, in 1978. His final story for DC was one of his favourites, Superman Vs Muhammad Ali (1978), with its famous cover containing dozens of celebrities (and colleagues) at ringside. His company moved in new directions, primarily providing storyboards for movies, but also into animation, game design, computer graphics and advertising. Adams could be a hard teacher, but he was also a supportive resource, whose wide respect in the field opened doors for newcomers. The artists gathered around Continuity Associates also packaged comics for the big companies; they were known as Crusty Bunkers. One of the most famous Bunkers, Denys Cowan, called Adams his second dad. Adams himself illustrated books and worked for some new independent publishers. For years he battled the big companies to establish copyright for artists; in 1987 he won a court decision that denied copyright but compelled the return of original art. Along with the golden age artist Jerry Robinson and the lawyer Ed Priess, he won Siegel, Shuster and their families recognition and royalties from DC just as the Superman franchise was becoming huge. In 2005, he returned to comics, later writing and drawing the miniseries Batman: Odyssey (2010) for DC and The First X-Men (2013) for Marvel. In 2008, Adams worked with the David S Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, Washington, lobbying the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum to return Dina Babbitts original artwork, drawn to illustrate Dr Josef Mengeles racial theories in order to save herself and her daughter from the gas chambers. He illustrated, with Kubert, a six-page story about Babbitt, with a foreword by Stan Lee; two years later he illustrated and narrated a Disney series, They Spoke Out: American Voices Against the Holocaust. Adams is survived by his second wife, Marilyn, whom he married in 1987, and their son, Josh, and by his daughters, Kris and Zeea, and sons, Joel and Jason, from his first marriage, to Cory Adams, a comics colourist, which ended in divorce.

In the period following the explosion begun by Marvel Comics in the 1960s and accelerated by the campy Batman TV series in the middle of the decade, Neal Adams, who has died aged 80 of complications from sepsis, was one of the greatest, and probably most influential, artists in comics. Adams was central to the rethinking of characters including Marvels X-Men and, for their rival DC Comics, the Spectre, Deadman and, most crucially, the Batman. He also brought about changes to business practices, most notably winning artists the right to their original artwork, and getting long-delayed credit and compensation in the 1980s for the Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. He reinvented the look of comic pages and characters, said the writer Neil Gaiman. He was the reason I drew Batman in every school exercise book. Adams combined the powerful dynamism and expressionist movement of early Marvels two masters, Jack Kirby (Fantastic Four, Captain America) and Steve Ditko (Spider Man, Doctor Strange). But his work, influenced by the limitations of four-panel daily comics and glossy ad work, also displayed the more romantic attractiveness usually offered by less dramatic artists. His characters could be as muscular as Frank Frazettas barbarians and as appealing as Alex Raymonds daily strips, but they soared through the panels, every movement telling the story  he was always cinematically aware of the viewers place outside the page. Adams knew early he wanted to draw comics. He was born on Governors Island, New York, where his father, Frank, was stationed with the US army. He grew up on bases, including in Germany, but his father was not heavily involved in his upbringing.

My friend Chris Jordan, who has died of Covid complications aged 63, was a nurse, addiction therapist and committed environmental activist. He was a Green party parliamentary candidate for Torridge and West Devon in two general elections, and a co-opted town councillor in North Tawton. Born in Dartford, Kent, to Marjorie (nee Port), a librarian, and Peter Jordan, a geologist, he attended Dulwich College and then studied environmental science at Cardiff University. Drawn to the caring professions, in 1979 he was about to start re-training in general and mental health nursing at Hereford general hospital when he was involved in a motorcycle accident that put him in a coma for several weeks and in hospital for months. Picking up the threads again, he completed his nurse training in the early 1980s and worked at Lewisham hospital. He later undertook specialist training in substance misuse and addiction, and worked with street drinkers and homeless people in London. In 2002, he met Sarah Jane Cross while they were both working in the community drug and alcohol team at Richmond community hospital. They married in 2009. By this time, Chris was managing a Salvation Army opiate detox and rehab project for Bangladeshi men in Londons East End. Chris and Sarah moved to Devon in 2012 and he took on various roles in local addiction services. In Devon, he became increasingly involved in local environmental causes and, inspired by Sarah, he became a practitioner of Kundalini yoga. In 2013 Chris was diagnosed with advanced follicular lymphoma and the same year he had a stroke. He was doggedly strong and he recovered, and went on to stand for the Green party in the 2017 and 2019 general elections, increasing his share of the vote the second time. He had recently been co-opted on to North Tawton town council for the Green party. Chris was compassionate, calm and kind. Through his activism and his work he influenced many people. Chris believed that healing the Earth could start with how people treat each other, and put this into action in his work and outside it. Chris was still working as a visiting carer and at a residential unit for brain and head injuries in Plymouth, but had been winding down his nursing career in favour of green activism. He was a trustee and active member of the North Tawton Environmental Trust and planted hundreds of trees. He campaigned against badger culling. In April 2020 he was one of the first people to arrive with his own tree on Waterloo Bridge for an Extinction Rebellion occupation. He is survived by Sarah.

My friend Chris Jordan, who has died of Covid complications aged 63, was a nurse, addiction therapist and committed environmental activist. He was a Green party parliamentary candidate for Torridge and West Devon in two general elections, and a co-opted town councillor in North Tawton. Born in Dartford, Kent, to Marjorie (nee Port), a librarian, and Peter Jordan, a geologist, he attended Dulwich College and then studied environmental science at Cardiff University. Drawn to the caring professions, in 1979 he was about to start re-training in general and mental health nursing at Hereford general hospital when he was involved in a motorcycle accident that put him in a coma for several weeks and in hospital for months. Picking up the threads again, he completed his nurse training in the early 1980s and worked at Lewisham hospital. He later undertook specialist training in substance misuse and addiction, and worked with street drinkers and homeless people in London. In 2002, he met Sarah Jane Cross while they were both working in the community drug and alcohol team at Richmond community hospital. They married in 2009. By this time, Chris was managing a Salvation Army opiate detox and rehab project for Bangladeshi men in Londons East End. Chris and Sarah moved to Devon in 2012 and he took on various roles in local addiction services. In Devon, he became increasingly involved in local environmental causes and, inspired by Sarah, he became a practitioner of Kundalini yoga. In 2013 Chris was diagnosed with advanced follicular lymphoma and the same year he had a stroke. He was doggedly strong and he recovered, and went on to stand for the Green party in the 2017 and 2019 general elections, increasing his share of the vote the second time. He had recently been co-opted on to North Tawton town council for the Green party. Chris was compassionate, calm and kind. Through his activism and his work he influenced many people. Chris believed that healing the Earth could start with how people treat each other, and put this into action in his work and outside it. Chris was still working as a visiting carer and at a residential unit for brain and head injuries in Plymouth, but had been winding down his nursing career in favour of green activism. He was a trustee and active member of the North Tawton Environmental Trust and planted hundreds of trees. He campaigned against badger culling. In April 2020 he was one of the first people to arrive with his own tree on Waterloo Bridge for an Extinction Rebellion occupation. He is survived by Sarah.

My friend Chris Jordan, who has died of Covid complications aged 63, was a nurse, addiction therapist and committed environmental activist. He was a Green party parliamentary candidate for Torridge and West Devon in two general elections, and a co-opted town councillor in North Tawton. Born in Dartford, Kent, to Marjorie (nee Port), a librarian, and Peter Jordan, a geologist, he attended Dulwich College and then studied environmental science at Cardiff University. Drawn to the caring professions, in 1979 he was about to start re-training in general and mental health nursing at Hereford general hospital when he was involved in a motorcycle accident that put him in a coma for several weeks and in hospital for months. Picking up the threads again, he completed his nurse training in the early 1980s and worked at Lewisham hospital. He later undertook specialist training in substance misuse and addiction, and worked with street drinkers and homeless people in London. In 2002, he met Sarah Jane Cross while they were both working in the community drug and alcohol team at Richmond community hospital. They married in 2009. By this time, Chris was managing a Salvation Army opiate detox and rehab project for Bangladeshi men in Londons East End. Chris and Sarah moved to Devon in 2012 and he took on various roles in local addiction services. In Devon, he became increasingly involved in local environmental causes and, inspired by Sarah, he became a practitioner of Kundalini yoga. In 2013 Chris was diagnosed with advanced follicular lymphoma and the same year he had a stroke. He was doggedly strong and he recovered, and went on to stand for the Green party in the 2017 and 2019 general elections, increasing his share of the vote the second time.

He was doggedly strong and he recovered, and went on to stand for the Green party in the 2017 and 2019 general elections, increasing his share of the vote the second time. He had recently been co-opted on to North Tawton town council for the Green party. Chris was compassionate, calm and kind. Through his activism and his work he influenced many people. Chris believed that healing the Earth could start with how people treat each other, and put this into action in his work and outside it. Chris was still working as a visiting carer and at a residential unit for brain and head injuries in Plymouth, but had been winding down his nursing career in favour of green activism. He was a trustee and active member of the North Tawton Environmental Trust and planted hundreds of trees. He campaigned against badger culling. In April 2020 he was one of the first people to arrive with his own tree on Waterloo Bridge for an Extinction Rebellion occupation. He is survived by Sarah.

My friend Chris Jordan, who has died of Covid complications aged 63, was a nurse, addiction therapist and committed environmental activist. He was a Green party parliamentary candidate for Torridge and West Devon in two general elections, and a co-opted town councillor in North Tawton. Born in Dartford, Kent, to Marjorie (nee Port), a librarian, and Peter Jordan, a geologist, he attended Dulwich College and then studied environmental science at Cardiff University. Drawn to the caring professions, in 1979 he was about to start re-training in general and mental health nursing at Hereford general hospital when he was involved in a motorcycle accident that put him in a coma for several weeks and in hospital for months. Picking up the threads again, he completed his nurse training in the early 1980s and worked at Lewisham hospital. He later undertook specialist training in substance misuse and addiction, and worked with street drinkers and homeless people in London. In 2002, he met Sarah Jane Cross while they were both working in the community drug and alcohol team at Richmond community hospital. They married in 2009. By this time, Chris was managing a Salvation Army opiate detox and rehab project for Bangladeshi men in Londons East End. Chris and Sarah moved to Devon in 2012 and he took on various roles in local addiction services. In Devon, he became increasingly involved in local environmental causes and, inspired by Sarah, he became a practitioner of Kundalini yoga. In 2013 Chris was diagnosed with advanced follicular lymphoma and the same year he had a stroke. He was doggedly strong and he recovered, and went on to stand for the Green party in the 2017 and 2019 general elections, increasing his share of the vote the second time.

Just as many of us grasped for connections during lockdown, the pandemic has inspired Eunic London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, to dwell on the meaning of relationships for this years showcase for European short films, put together by curator Shira Macleod. Not all are  as the strands subtitle would have it  loving encounters: break-ups, bureaucratic frustration and unsettling alien fauna crop up, too. And the one explicitly Covid-related work, Romanian director Alina Manolaches mesmerising I Am Here, features relationships by their absence: the social vacuum on display in CCTV footage from the Trevi Fountain, Chinese pharmacies, a British golf course and other depopulated locations around the world. Relationships take a politicised shade in Alexandra Matheous A Summer Place, a lush dalliance between a Cypriot food artist and the Arab refugee she rescues from the sea. But its Paolo Sorrentino-esque scenes of excess draw the lines between European haves and outsider have-nots somewhat heavy-handedly. More subtle on the immigration beat is the forlorn black-and-white drama Beyond Is the Day, from Polands Damian Kocur, which turns an out-of-the-way river barge into an intercontinental metaphor. Eunics selection broadly tries to buoy us up as societies emerge from the pandemic with an upbeat view of relationships, as in the delightful Forest Coal Pit, by Sin Marshall-Waters, about a pair of elderly Welsh brothers who, despite the rigours of running their farm, are never short on wonder about the world. Well, theyre in perpetual motion, shrews, arent they? one marvels. But theres an anxious pulse to Cuckoo!, in which Dutch director Jrgen Scholtens puts his cuckoo clock-dwelling protagonist on a tight schedule, ensuring an elderly lady takes her medication; it plays like an absurdist Werthers Original advert. An even angstier mother frets about sexual predators on behalf of her gay son in Are You Hungry?, creating a honeytrap profile for him as Tomi of Finland. But Teemu Niukkanens droll and sharply characterised feature asserts that the kids are alright. I like rainbows as natural phenomena, deadpans Tomi about his LGBT-flagging T-shirt. Most striking are two shorts from Croatia and Scotland. The resplendent Into the Blue is a teenage love triangle unfolding in a relaxed riviera setting, only with intense undercurrents. Gracija Filipovic is darkly seductive as the interloper crashing her childhood friends budding romance, while director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanovi makes the sapphire depths undulate with loneliness and liberation. Josephine Lohoar Selfs animation The Fabric of You sounds cosier, but theres an unsettling texture to its tryst between a Bronx mouse tailor and his well-spoken client. This rodent Remains of the Day discourses smoothly on the link between fashion and dissimulation, while its frayed, writhing stop-motion hints at agony beneath the breast. The standard of work is perhaps more consistent than that of last years group, but its also notable that, with plenty in the 15- to 25-minute range, the selection pushes the definition of short. One final mention then to Maria Fredrikssons documentary entry Svonni vs the Swedish Tax Agency, which manages to pack in a tale of one women and her dog, her struggle to get it recognised as tax-deductible, and the broader context of Sami reindeer herding, in a succinct and springy five minutes. Brief encounters can be the most intense.  In Short, Europe: Loving Encounters is at Cin Lumire, London, on 7 May.

Just as many of us grasped for connections during lockdown, the pandemic has inspired Eunic London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, to dwell on the meaning of relationships for this years showcase for European short films, put together by curator Shira Macleod. Not all are  as the strands subtitle would have it  loving encounters: break-ups, bureaucratic frustration and unsettling alien fauna crop up, too. And the one explicitly Covid-related work, Romanian director Alina Manolaches mesmerising I Am Here, features relationships by their absence: the social vacuum on display in CCTV footage from the Trevi Fountain, Chinese pharmacies, a British golf course and other depopulated locations around the world. Relationships take a politicised shade in Alexandra Matheous A Summer Place, a lush dalliance between a Cypriot food artist and the Arab refugee she rescues from the sea. But its Paolo Sorrentino-esque scenes of excess draw the lines between European haves and outsider have-nots somewhat heavy-handedly. More subtle on the immigration beat is the forlorn black-and-white drama Beyond Is the Day, from Polands Damian Kocur, which turns an out-of-the-way river barge into an intercontinental metaphor. Eunics selection broadly tries to buoy us up as societies emerge from the pandemic with an upbeat view of relationships, as in the delightful Forest Coal Pit, by Sin Marshall-Waters, about a pair of elderly Welsh brothers who, despite the rigours of running their farm, are never short on wonder about the world. Well, theyre in perpetual motion, shrews, arent they? one marvels. But theres an anxious pulse to Cuckoo!, in which Dutch director Jrgen Scholtens puts his cuckoo clock-dwelling protagonist on a tight schedule, ensuring an elderly lady takes her medication; it plays like an absurdist Werthers Original advert. An even angstier mother frets about sexual predators on behalf of her gay son in Are You Hungry?, creating a honeytrap profile for him as Tomi of Finland. But Teemu Niukkanens droll and sharply characterised feature asserts that the kids are alright. I like rainbows as natural phenomena, deadpans Tomi about his LGBT-flagging T-shirt. Most striking are two shorts from Croatia and Scotland. The resplendent Into the Blue is a teenage love triangle unfolding in a relaxed riviera setting, only with intense undercurrents. Gracija Filipovic is darkly seductive as the interloper crashing her childhood friends budding romance, while director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanovi makes the sapphire depths undulate with loneliness and liberation. Josephine Lohoar Selfs animation The Fabric of You sounds cosier, but theres an unsettling texture to its tryst between a Bronx mouse tailor and his well-spoken client. This rodent Remains of the Day discourses smoothly on the link between fashion and dissimulation, while its frayed, writhing stop-motion hints at agony beneath the breast. The standard of work is perhaps more consistent than that of last years group, but its also notable that, with plenty in the 15- to 25-minute range, the selection pushes the definition of short. One final mention then to Maria Fredrikssons documentary entry Svonni vs the Swedish Tax Agency, which manages to pack in a tale of one women and her dog, her struggle to get it recognised as tax-deductible, and the broader context of Sami reindeer herding, in a succinct and springy five minutes. Brief encounters can be the most intense.  In Short, Europe: Loving Encounters is at Cin Lumire, London, on 7 May.

Frank Lampard has said Everton have no divine right to their Premier League status and must improve in the summer to avoid a repeat of this seasons relegation struggle. Lampard achieved his immediate task of securing Evertons survival with Thursdays dramatic comeback defeat of Crystal Palace. After the raucous celebrations, however, he turned his attention to the rebuilding work required and admitted Everton could not take for granted their 68-year residence in the top flight. The Everton manager, asked whether the club were too big to be fighting relegation, said: Yes, but is it? What right does Everton have to be Premier League safe every year and think that will continue forever more? There are a lot of decisions that have to be made and performances that we have to do and my job has to be done as well as it can be to make sure that happens. We need to try and find improvements to make sure it is not but nothing is given. We were in that position because we deserved to be. It is important to say that. We dont want to be here next season but we understand if we dont make positive moves it could be possible. So we will be ready to move on that quickly. I dont think we can expect 10,000 people to turn up and parade us in every game. It doesnt work that way. The fans have dragged us over the line with that kind of behaviour. But at the same time, we as a club need to start fresh from zero next season, which is a nice thing, especially for me to come in with a pre-season and start at zero rather than looking downwards, and make the decisions in the meantime that mean we improve. Lampard has established a good working relationship with Kevin Thelwell, who was appointed as the director of football in February, and said plans were in place for the summer, despite the uncertainty that had surrounded the clubs future. We have been working behind the scenes, he said. I have a great relationship with Kevin in terms of where I feel we can move forward with the squad and not just that, but structurally so we can be better from day to day. My biggest thing here is that I want a happy, determined camp that moves in the same direction and that is something we have to look at. Those conversations have started. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Jordan Pickford have been linked with summer moves but, despite Evertons recent financial losses, Lampard insists he has not been told so far that he must sell to buy. He said: If I had my way let me keep players who perform really well for the club and let us get as far up the table as we can, but we will see about that.

Thomas Tuchel has urged Romelu Lukaku to follow in Timo Werners footsteps and grasp the opportunity if the Belgian is given the chance for Chelsea at Wembley. Werner is in pole position to start in attack against Crystal Palace in Sundays FA Cup semi-final after scoring three goals against Southampton and Real Madrid in the past week. Lukaku is available again after missing those games but the striker has struggled to impress since his return to Stamford Bridge last summer. Although he has managed three goals during their FA Cup run, Lukaku, who was fined by the club for an unsanctioned interview with Sky Italia last year, has not scored in the Premier League since December. When asked if Lukaku needed to take his chance in the way Werner has over the past week, Tuchel said: For sure. He had a huge chance against Real Madrid [at home] and things can go so fast. Nobody knows what this goal would have done for us if he had taken his chance with the late header in the first leg. It is exactly what he needs to do. Wait, be patient, work hard and put the team first, be ready to help the team, because as a striker you can help within seconds. Werner has also failed to solidify his place in the Chelsea attack since joining from RB Leipzig in 2020, with his stuttering form holding him back, but Tuchel said it will be difficult to leave the striker out of the semi-final based on recent performances. Tuchel said: Especially for strikers, things can be turned around in minutes, in moments. Whole careers can be upside down and in any direction but always as a striker you can have a chance to put things into your favour, as a substitute or if you have the chance to perform from the beginning. The former chancellor George Osborne has been drafted in to boost Todd Boehlys bid to buy Chelsea. The involvement of the former Conservative MP with the Boehly consortium adds an extra edge to the LA Dodgers co-owners candidacy. The London investment bank Robey Warshaw, where Osborne works as a partner, is understood to have signed on to the Boehly bid in an advisory capacity. The influence of a former cabinet minister adds to what was already a strong bid for Chelsea. Osborne is a Chelsea fan and attended their 2012 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich. The New York merchant bank the Raine Group is poised to select a preferred bidder to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich next week.

Tuchel said: Especially for strikers, things can be turned around in minutes, in moments. Whole careers can be upside down and in any direction but always as a striker you can have a chance to put things into your favour, as a substitute or if you have the chance to perform from the beginning. The former chancellor George Osborne has been drafted in to boost Todd Boehlys bid to buy Chelsea. The involvement of the former Conservative MP with the Boehly consortium adds an extra edge to the LA Dodgers co-owners candidacy. The London investment bank Robey Warshaw, where Osborne works as a partner, is understood to have signed on to the Boehly bid in an advisory capacity. The influence of a former cabinet minister adds to what was already a strong bid for Chelsea. Osborne is a Chelsea fan and attended their 2012 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich. The New York merchant bank the Raine Group is poised to select a preferred bidder to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich next week.

Eddie Howe is pinning his hopes on an apparently reborn Joelinton helping to spearhead a revival as Newcastle seek their first win. Not that the 40m Brazilian striker will necessarily be leading from the front. Joelinton, who has looked a player transformed since Howe took over as manager last month, shone in a No 8 midfield role after Newcastle were reduced to 10 men by Ciaran Clarks early dismissal during Tuesdays 1-1 draw at home to Norwich. Indeed Joelinton appeared a far better enforcer than a striker as he persistently frustrated Norwich. Hes covered every blade of grass for us, said Howe, who knows that with Newcastle increasingly adrift at the bottom, victory on Saturday at home to his former club Burnley is imperative. Joelintons given everything for the team. Hes got a real selfless mindset and I think he can continue to improve; hes going to be a huge player for us. We really, really like him; I think hes got a good mix of physicality, technical ability and tactical intelligence. You saw some superb footwork from him in tight areas on Tuesday when he started as a No 10 and then moved to midfield where, after very little instruction, he showed high tactical awareness. He was brilliant. Howe has been particularly impressed by the versatility of a player his predecessor, Steve Bruce, once claimed was uninterested in scoring. For me hes already played three or four positions and played them all very well, Howe said. I think well probably play him in different positions against different opponents. Joelinton can be whatever he wants to be  I think you have an outstanding individual who is only going to get better. There was a time when Newcastle seemed desperate to offload their low-scoring record signing but Howe has very different ideas. I wouldnt swap Joelinton, he said. I really like him as a person and I think we can take his game to new heights. After watching Joelinton on television before coming here I always liked him but, now having worked with him and seen the personality, the human being, behind the player, I like him even more.

Eddie Howe is pinning his hopes on an apparently reborn Joelinton helping to spearhead a revival as Newcastle seek their first win. Not that the 40m Brazilian striker will necessarily be leading from the front. Joelinton, who has looked a player transformed since Howe took over as manager last month, shone in a No 8 midfield role after Newcastle were reduced to 10 men by Ciaran Clarks early dismissal during Tuesdays 1-1 draw at home to Norwich. Indeed Joelinton appeared a far better enforcer than a striker as he persistently frustrated Norwich. Hes covered every blade of grass for us, said Howe, who knows that with Newcastle increasingly adrift at the bottom, victory on Saturday at home to his former club Burnley is imperative. Joelintons given everything for the team. Hes got a real selfless mindset and I think he can continue to improve; hes going to be a huge player for us. We really, really like him; I think hes got a good mix of physicality, technical ability and tactical intelligence. You saw some superb footwork from him in tight areas on Tuesday when he started as a No 10 and then moved to midfield where, after very little instruction, he showed high tactical awareness. He was brilliant. Howe has been particularly impressed by the versatility of a player his predecessor, Steve Bruce, once claimed was uninterested in scoring. For me hes already played three or four positions and played them all very well, Howe said. I think well probably play him in different positions against different opponents. Joelinton can be whatever he wants to be  I think you have an outstanding individual who is only going to get better. There was a time when Newcastle seemed desperate to offload their low-scoring record signing but Howe has very different ideas. I wouldnt swap Joelinton, he said. I really like him as a person and I think we can take his game to new heights. After watching Joelinton on television before coming here I always liked him but, now having worked with him and seen the personality, the human being, behind the player, I like him even more.

After watching Joelinton on television before coming here I always liked him but, now having worked with him and seen the personality, the human being, behind the player, I like him even more.

Eddie Howe is pinning his hopes on an apparently reborn Joelinton helping to spearhead a revival as Newcastle seek their first win. Not that the 40m Brazilian striker will necessarily be leading from the front. Joelinton, who has looked a player transformed since Howe took over as manager last month, shone in a No 8 midfield role after Newcastle were reduced to 10 men by Ciaran Clarks early dismissal during Tuesdays 1-1 draw at home to Norwich. Indeed Joelinton appeared a far better enforcer than a striker as he persistently frustrated Norwich. Hes covered every blade of grass for us, said Howe, who knows that with Newcastle increasingly adrift at the bottom, victory on Saturday at home to his former club Burnley is imperative. Joelintons given everything for the team. Hes got a real selfless mindset and I think he can continue to improve; hes going to be a huge player for us. We really, really like him; I think hes got a good mix of physicality, technical ability and tactical intelligence. You saw some superb footwork from him in tight areas on Tuesday when he started as a No 10 and then moved to midfield where, after very little instruction, he showed high tactical awareness. He was brilliant. Howe has been particularly impressed by the versatility of a player his predecessor, Steve Bruce, once claimed was uninterested in scoring. For me hes already played three or four positions and played them all very well, Howe said. I think well probably play him in different positions against different opponents. Joelinton can be whatever he wants to be  I think you have an outstanding individual who is only going to get better.

Tottenham are into the next round and will not care how they spluttered against the equally misfiring Burnley. In a tie where classy moments were scarce the winner came from a sole sparkling sequence that had Emerson Royal roving along the right-backs flank before his delivery was met by Lucas Mouras cool header. On this showing Ole Gunnar Solskjr and Manchester United would seem to have an ideal opponent on Saturday against whom to arrest their dire form, though Tottenham were only at half-strength. For Burnley this outing was the story of their campaign: disappointing and offering little optimism they can transform their play into what they need to start doing soon with regularity  be victorious. Burnleys sole win in their 12 matches remains the previous rounds 4-1 knockout of Rochdale. Sean Dyche said: Its hard to fault them at the minute. There are a lot of things they are doing right. Weve got to turn the corner. Its frustrating for me to keep saying it, but were not far away. They are doing everything to make it happen. Harry Kane, Cristian Romero, Pierre-Emile Hjbjerg, Oliver Skipp and Emerson Royal were a firstchoice quintet retained by Nuno Esprito Santo from the defeat at West Ham on Sunday but Harry Winks and Dele Alli were left out completely. Tottenhams manager was asked if the latter pair will feature when United visit. They are our players so anything is possible, he said. This is my answer. We continue to focus on getting the best out of each of our players. Dele is one of the cases we have to try and improve. Spurs were pinned back for the majority of the opening period: possession was scant and their ideas with it even less. Steven Bergwijn certainly had the right intent when Emerson swung the ball over from the right but the forwards volley became an embarrassing miskick, to the delight of the Burnley faithful. Still, Bryan Gil had been forced off with what appeared a muscular problem and his replacement, Lucas Moura, infused required pace into Tottenham as one burst through the centre illustrated. Missing, though, was simple quality. When Hjbjerg tried to dazzle with footwork but ran the ball straight out this was his team and a below-par first half in microcosm. The sides were soporific and thus any error might be the only way the deadlock would be broken. Kane supplied one of these yet in falling backwards and spraying an effort skywards it was the wrong type. A quarter-final berth beckoned for the team who moved into any sort of gear. After the interval Spurs did so, at last moving the ball quickly forward as Moura and Kane tried  unsuccessfully  to sneak behind Ben Mee and the rest of the captains rearguard. This sparked Burnley. Erik Pieters floated the ball to Johann Berg Gudmundsson, whose header to Matej Vydra should have been finished but Spurs escaped. As the hour mark approached it was difficult to remember if either Nick Pope or Pierluigi Gollini had made a save, so lacking in edge was the action. A hardly packed Turf Moor raised the volume to inspire greater fare and when Kane fed Giovani Lo Celso his stabbed attempt at last had Pope needing his reflexes to repel. Now Nuno sent on Son Heung-min and Tanguy Ndombele for Bergwijn and Skipp  a proactive move  and Spurs scored, Moura beating Pope. Burnley rallied and Maxwel Cornet saw a cross kicked away by Davinson Snchez. But Tottenham ended far happier at the final whistle.

Weve got to turn the corner. Its frustrating for me to keep saying it, but were not far away. They are doing everything to make it happen. Harry Kane, Cristian Romero, Pierre-Emile Hjbjerg, Oliver Skipp and Emerson Royal were a firstchoice quintet retained by Nuno Esprito Santo from the defeat at West Ham on Sunday but Harry Winks and Dele Alli were left out completely. Tottenhams manager was asked if the latter pair will feature when United visit. They are our players so anything is possible, he said. This is my answer. We continue to focus on getting the best out of each of our players. Dele is one of the cases we have to try and improve. Spurs were pinned back for the majority of the opening period: possession was scant and their ideas with it even less. Steven Bergwijn certainly had the right intent when Emerson swung the ball over from the right but the forwards volley became an embarrassing miskick, to the delight of the Burnley faithful. Still, Bryan Gil had been forced off with what appeared a muscular problem and his replacement, Lucas Moura, infused required pace into Tottenham as one burst through the centre illustrated. Missing, though, was simple quality. When Hjbjerg tried to dazzle with footwork but ran the ball straight out this was his team and a below-par first half in microcosm. The sides were soporific and thus any error might be the only way the deadlock would be broken. Kane supplied one of these yet in falling backwards and spraying an effort skywards it was the wrong type. A quarter-final berth beckoned for the team who moved into any sort of gear. After the interval Spurs did so, at last moving the ball quickly forward as Moura and Kane tried  unsuccessfully  to sneak behind Ben Mee and the rest of the captains rearguard. This sparked Burnley. Erik Pieters floated the ball to Johann Berg Gudmundsson, whose header to Matej Vydra should have been finished but Spurs escaped. As the hour mark approached it was difficult to remember if either Nick Pope or Pierluigi Gollini had made a save, so lacking in edge was the action. A hardly packed Turf Moor raised the volume to inspire greater fare and when Kane fed Giovani Lo Celso his stabbed attempt at last had Pope needing his reflexes to repel. Now Nuno sent on Son Heung-min and Tanguy Ndombele for Bergwijn and Skipp  a proactive move  and Spurs scored, Moura beating Pope. Burnley rallied and Maxwel Cornet saw a cross kicked away by Davinson Snchez. But Tottenham ended far happier at the final whistle.

Tottenham are into the next round and will not care how they spluttered against the equally misfiring Burnley. In a tie where classy moments were scarce the winner came from a sole sparkling sequence that had Emerson Royal roving along the right-backs flank before his delivery was met by Lucas Mouras cool header.

Tottenham are into the next round and will not care how they spluttered against the equally misfiring Burnley. In a tie where classy moments were scarce the winner came from a sole sparkling sequence that had Emerson Royal roving along the right-backs flank before his delivery was met by Lucas Mouras cool header. On this showing Ole Gunnar Solskjr and Manchester United would seem to have an ideal opponent on Saturday against whom to arrest their dire form, though Tottenham were only at half-strength. For Burnley this outing was the story of their campaign: disappointing and offering little optimism they can transform their play into what they need to start doing soon with regularity  be victorious. Burnleys sole win in their 12 matches remains the previous rounds 4-1 knockout of Rochdale. Sean Dyche said: Its hard to fault them at the minute. There are a lot of things they are doing right. Weve got to turn the corner. Its frustrating for me to keep saying it, but were not far away. They are doing everything to make it happen. Harry Kane, Cristian Romero, Pierre-Emile Hjbjerg, Oliver Skipp and Emerson Royal were a firstchoice quintet retained by Nuno Esprito Santo from the defeat at West Ham on Sunday but Harry Winks and Dele Alli were left out completely. Tottenhams manager was asked if the latter pair will feature when United visit. They are our players so anything is possible, he said. This is my answer. We continue to focus on getting the best out of each of our players. Dele is one of the cases we have to try and improve. Spurs were pinned back for the majority of the opening period: possession was scant and their ideas with it even less. Steven Bergwijn certainly had the right intent when Emerson swung the ball over from the right but the forwards volley became an embarrassing miskick, to the delight of the Burnley faithful. Still, Bryan Gil had been forced off with what appeared a muscular problem and his replacement, Lucas Moura, infused required pace into Tottenham as one burst through the centre illustrated. Missing, though, was simple quality. When Hjbjerg tried to dazzle with footwork but ran the ball straight out this was his team and a below-par first half in microcosm. The sides were soporific and thus any error might be the only way the deadlock would be broken. Kane supplied one of these yet in falling backwards and spraying an effort skywards it was the wrong type. A quarter-final berth beckoned for the team who moved into any sort of gear. After the interval Spurs did so, at last moving the ball quickly forward as Moura and Kane tried  unsuccessfully  to sneak behind Ben Mee and the rest of the captains rearguard. This sparked Burnley. Erik Pieters floated the ball to Johann Berg Gudmundsson, whose header to Matej Vydra should have been finished but Spurs escaped. As the hour mark approached it was difficult to remember if either Nick Pope or Pierluigi Gollini had made a save, so lacking in edge was the action. A hardly packed Turf Moor raised the volume to inspire greater fare and when Kane fed Giovani Lo Celso his stabbed attempt at last had Pope needing his reflexes to repel. Now Nuno sent on Son Heung-min and Tanguy Ndombele for Bergwijn and Skipp  a proactive move  and Spurs scored, Moura beating Pope. Burnley rallied and Maxwel Cornet saw a cross kicked away by Davinson Snchez. But Tottenham ended far happier at the final whistle.

Kane supplied one of these yet in falling backwards and spraying an effort skywards it was the wrong type. A quarter-final berth beckoned for the team who moved into any sort of gear. After the interval Spurs did so, at last moving the ball quickly forward as Moura and Kane tried  unsuccessfully  to sneak behind Ben Mee and the rest of the captains rearguard. This sparked Burnley. Erik Pieters floated the ball to Johann Berg Gudmundsson, whose header to Matej Vydra should have been finished but Spurs escaped. As the hour mark approached it was difficult to remember if either Nick Pope or Pierluigi Gollini had made a save, so lacking in edge was the action. A hardly packed Turf Moor raised the volume to inspire greater fare and when Kane fed Giovani Lo Celso his stabbed attempt at last had Pope needing his reflexes to repel. Now Nuno sent on Son Heung-min and Tanguy Ndombele for Bergwijn and Skipp  a proactive move  and Spurs scored, Moura beating Pope. Burnley rallied and Maxwel Cornet saw a cross kicked away by Davinson Snchez. But Tottenham ended far happier at the final whistle.

As the Sue Gray report  or the long wait for it  again dominates the headlines, whither the comedian who leaked his own version of it, four months ago? That stunt, which caused mass panic in the corridors of power, is one of several revisited in a touring show by the nations favourite prankster, Joe Lycett. Inviting the Lord Mayor of Birmingham to open his new kitchen extension, trolling the low-rent brands who ask him to endorse their products online, Twitter spats with Alan Sugar  all are reprised with slides and footage on an upstage screen and in-person commentary from the joker himself. Its not a brand of live comedy that puts the emphasis on liveness. Much of the funniness is located in the past; were just hearing about it (and watching it on a screen) after the event. And the show never really builds up a head of steam. Its constructed around a stunt  a campaign, even  that Lycett has been working on for years, the details of which were asked not to reveal. It makes for a heartwarming tale, rooted in Brummie Lycetts civic pride, and his outrage when protests were mounted locally against LGBT teaching in schools. But its not, comically speaking, his biggest-hitting stunt. It lacks an authority figure for Lycett to needle and wind up, and the cloak-and-dagger business it involves feels superfluous. If the show remains consistently enjoyable, we can thank Lycetts good-eggishness, and the contagious delight he takes in his often puerile tomfoolery. When he writes a guide to gay sex for infant readers; when his painting is hung in a gallery next to a ridiculous list of the materials (ghost goats milk) used in its creation; when he tweets lovingly in support of the PM and is retweeted by Nadine Dorries  its four parts silliness to one part revelry in the opportunity for weapons-grade impudence that his celebrity presents. One might wish for more in-the-moment material, less dependent on stunts and tweets Lycett has already (and often publicly) dispatched. But there is no denying this stuff was funny first time around, and Lycetts arch commentary and bonhomie make it all the more so.  On tour until 23 September Touring Joe Lycett

Joo Cancelo suffered a violent attack at his home on Thursday evening, with the Manchester City defender left with visible facial injuries. He has branded the four intruders as cowards. The incident is being investigated by police, and Cancelos ability to travel with Pep Guardiolas squad for Saturdays match against Arsenal is in doubt. The 27-year-old posted a picture of himself on his Instagram account in which he was shown to be cut above the right eye and bruised. In the post, Cancelo said: Unfortunately today I was assaulted by four cowards who hurt me and tried to hurt my family. When you show resistance this is what happens. I dont know how there are people with such meanness. The most important thing for me is my family and luckily they are all OK. After so many obstacles in my life this is just one more that I will overcome. Firm and strong, like always. It is understood that City staff were at Cancelos home on Thursday evening to support him and his family. A decision regarding whether Cancelo can travel to London to face Arsenal is to be taken some time on Friday. A City statement said: We are shocked and appalled that Joo Cancelo and his family were subjected to a burglary at their home this evening during which Joo was also assaulted. Joo and his family are being supported by the club and he is helping the police with their enquiries as they investigate this very serious matter.

Joo Cancelo suffered a violent attack at his home on Thursday evening, with the Manchester City defender left with visible facial injuries. He has branded the four intruders as cowards. The incident is being investigated by police, and Cancelos ability to travel with Pep Guardiolas squad for Saturdays match against Arsenal is in doubt. The 27-year-old posted a picture of himself on his Instagram account in which he was shown to be cut above the right eye and bruised. In the post, Cancelo said: Unfortunately today I was assaulted by four cowards who hurt me and tried to hurt my family. When you show resistance this is what happens. I dont know how there are people with such meanness. The most important thing for me is my family and luckily they are all OK. After so many obstacles in my life this is just one more that I will overcome. Firm and strong, like always. It is understood that City staff were at Cancelos home on Thursday evening to support him and his family. A decision regarding whether Cancelo can travel to London to face Arsenal is to be taken some time on Friday. A City statement said: We are shocked and appalled that Joo Cancelo and his family were subjected to a burglary at their home this evening during which Joo was also assaulted. Joo and his family are being supported by the club and he is helping the police with their enquiries as they investigate this very serious matter.

Grenada is playing host to an absorbing series decider between West Indies and England, if not always by way of quality out in the middle then certainly in terms of injecting some much needed Caribbean soul into proceedings. The steel drummers have been wonderfully relentless and the locals have already turned up in good numbers for what is the islands first Test match in seven years; the arrival of the weekend promises a further rise here, so too a match situation which, after two topsy-turvy days, appears on a knife edge. Those who are drawn to the National Cricket Stadium in St Georges first thing will see West Indies resume on 232 for eight, with a lead of 28 over their visitors. It follows three hard-fought sessions of cricket that, like the previous day, saw a top-order collapse offset by a feisty rearguard down the order. Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six  109 runs behind  and changing the complexion of the day. Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, Englands attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring  some 16 decisions have been overturned  when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End  named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages  and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home. At the other end Overton followed the approach amid a fiery battle with John Campbell. The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overtons innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in Englands 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six  109 runs behind  and changing the complexion of the day. Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, Englands attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring  some 16 decisions have been overturned  when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End  named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages  and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home. At the other end Overton followed the approach amid a fiery battle with John Campbell. The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overtons innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in Englands 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

Obduracy was his default setting but when the right-hander took on the second new ball before the close, whipping Craig Overton through mid-wicket for a stylish four that brought up his fourth Test half-century, Englands attack looked ready to plunge their feet in buckets of ice overnight. After the dull draws in Antigua and Barbados, the capricious nature of this surface has upped the entertainment levels significantly. And though England could not muster the same lavish sideways movement as their hosts found on the opening day, they discovered during the first two sessions that by smashing the ball hard into the pitch, its variable bounce brought rewards. This was a tactic Chris Woakes used to good effect during an afternoon that saw West Indies crumble from 71 for three to 134 for seven. Sheepish after an all-too friendly new ball spell that induced the double teapot from Joe Root, and knowing this tour had so far done little to assuage talk of a poor overseas record, Woakes delivered a fine three-wicket burst that gutted the middle order. First went Nkrumah Bonner, gloving behind after he failed to drop his hands while evading a bouncer, then Jason Holder for his third sorry dismissal in a row when he top-edged a pull shot third ball. Jermaine Blackwood might have felt a touch unlucky in a series of poor umpiring  some 16 decisions have been overturned  when he was lbw to one projected to merely scratch leg stump. Ben Stokes, who capped the second session with a gifted removal of Kyle Mayers for 28, had led the way here first thing. Battling an angry left knee and hobbling all day, Stokes claimed the first precious breakthrough in the 17th over when he charged in from the Darbeau End  named after the verdant neighbouring hills that are pockmarked with colourful cottages  and shot one low into the pads of Kraigg Brathwaite on 17. It was the simplest of lbw decisions for the umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, followed by an almost carbon copy grubber from Saqib Mahmood that sent Sharmarh Brooks packing for 13. Neither England bowler even felt compelled to appeal, proving Stuart Broad is here in spirit, at least, while he and Jimmy Anderson negotiate the fairways of St Andrews back home. At the other end Overton followed the approach amid a fiery battle with John Campbell. The opener cracked a couple of lusty fours during Overtons innocuous opening spell but the England man won round two with a knockout, twice hitting Campbell on the helmet with nasty bouncers before a short ball to the hip area was gloved behind on 35. Overton was also the bowler when England picked up their solitary wicket of the evening session, Joseph having once again shown his fighting qualities during a restorative eighth wicket stand with Da Silva, only to attempt an ambitious slog down the ground on 28 and under-edge behind. But as had been the case 24 hours earlier, when Mahmood and Jack Leach had turned the tide with a 90-run 10th-wicket stand in Englands 204 all out, the softening of this Dukes ball and miles in the legs of the bowlers saw conditions ease significantly for lower-order batters prepared to fight their corner; Roach, who drove Stokes through cover to bring up the lead, is certainly one of those. England have the benefit of knowing West Indies must bat last on this surface but equally they must get a defendable target on the board first. Going by how the two top orders have fared so far, this wont be entirely straightforward.

Grenada is playing host to an absorbing series decider between West Indies and England, if not always by way of quality out in the middle then certainly in terms of injecting some much needed Caribbean soul into proceedings. The steel drummers have been wonderfully relentless and the locals have already turned up in good numbers for what is the islands first Test match in seven years; the arrival of the weekend promises a further rise here, so too a match situation which, after two topsy-turvy days, appears on a knife edge. Those who are drawn to the National Cricket Stadium in St Georges first thing will see West Indies resume on 232 for eight, with a lead of 28 over their visitors. It follows three hard-fought sessions of cricket that, like the previous day, saw a top-order collapse offset by a feisty rearguard down the order. Joshua Da Silva, the young Trinidadian wicketkeeper who says he is loving every second of his first taste of a proper crowd in Test cricket, will start out unbeaten on 54 from 152 balls. He had played beautifully in the final session, marshalling stands of 49 with Alzarri Joseph (28) and then an unbeaten one of 55 with Kemar Roach, 25 not out, like an old pro. Da Silva is a bit of an imposter at No 8, it must be said, having dropped down the West Indies batting card due to the inclusion of two all-rounders. But as an insurance policy, the 23-year-old has worked wonders here, arriving with his side on 95 for six  109 runs behind  and changing the complexion of the day.

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line.

The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting.

Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope!

Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72.

Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams.

It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared.

Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles.

All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand.

He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here.

A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory. Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one.

Malone will take. Everyone lines up just outside the box. 90 min +1: Smith causes some brief panic in the Palace defence, challenging for a long ball on the edge of the box. But Palace regroup well, and eventually Billy Mitchell is forced to run the ball out for a goal kick by his namesake Tyrick. 90 min: Millwall will have five extra minutes in which to rescue their situation. 89 min: A minute of sterile Palace possession. Every second counts. 88 min: Palace make a couple of changes. Schlupp and the marvellous Olise make way for Clyne and Riedewald. 87 min: Billy Mitchell curls one in from the right. Its a dangerous ball. Guehi flicks a header away from the lurking Cooper. Boateng slides in at the far post but cant bundle home. So close to taking this to extra time! 85 min: Long is good to continue. 84 min: Olise nearly releases Gallagher down the right. Long slides out to smother. Gallagher accidentally clips the keeper in the mouth. On comes the trainer to see whats what. 83 min: Butland is booked for timewasting. 82 min: Palace respond by replacing Hughes with the more defensive-minded Milivojevic. 81 min: Millwall swap out their entire front line. Off go Ojo, Adobe and Bradshaw; on come Burey, Boateng and Smith. 80 min: Millwall are winning most of the 50-50s right now. Palace are dropping deeper, looking to hang onto their lead. 78 min: Afobe, his back to goal just inside the Palace box, tees up Bennett, who sidefoots carefully towards the bottom left. No oomph behind it, though, and its an easy gather for Butland. 77 min: Ward barges Bennett out on the left, and its a free kick in a dangerous position for Millwall, who load the box. Hutchinson sends it in, but its cleared well by Ward, mopping up his own mess. 76 min: A couple of crisp, clear C-bombs ring out across the nation on lunchtime ITV. The home fans have their dander up. 74 min: Ojo curls one in from the right. Malone hasnt gambled, and Gallagher can shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. Millwall are finally asking a couple of questions. 72 min: A game of bagatelle in the Palace box. The ball drops to Afobe, but he cant send an effort goalward. A little better from the hosts, though. 71 min: A bit of possession for Millwall, but they do very little with it. Palace look set for the fourth round right now, unless the hosts can haul themselves up off the canvas. 69 min: Ojo sends a directionless cross in from the right. Millwall havent achieved much in this second half. 67 min: As Olise prepares to take the corner, hes hit on the head by what looks like a plastic bottle. No harm done to the player, thankfully, but whats wrong with people? Anyway, nothing comes of the resulting set piece. 66 min: Gallagher sends a deep cross in from the right. McNamara is forced to head behind for a corner. Olise goes over to take it. 64 min: Palace respond with a double change of their own, replacing Eze and Mateta with Benteke and Edouard. No respite for Millwall. 62 min: Millwall make their second change, and this time its a tactical one. Bennett comes on to bolster the midfield, replacing centre-back Pearce. 61 min: The restart took a while, incidentally, a result of some dim bulb flinging a flare onto the pitch. Expect plenty of added time at the end of this game. 60 min: What a cross that was. In the first 13 minutes of the second half, Olise has scored one, set up another, and hit the woodwork. The third round of the FA Cup, right here! Olise is borderline unplayable at the moment. Palace break, and Olise is sent scampering down the right. He eases past Cooper, checks, then curls a delicious cross onto Matetas head. Mateta cant miss, and doesnt, steering a clinical header across Long and into the bottom left. Thats a lovely goal. 56 min: Local lad Billy Mitchell is booked for a cynical clip on Gallaghers heel. 55 min: Speaking of Selhurst, heres a reminder that there are no replays in this years FA Cup, a consequence of this goddamned pandemic. This tie will be decided today, after extra time and penalties if necessary. 54 min: Olise versus Malone out on the right, take three. This time, having made space for yet another shot, his curler, aimed for the top left, sails harmlessly over the bar. 53 min: Kieftenbeld balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar. That ones already halfway to Selhurst Park. 51 min: Olise is this close to making a carbon copy of his goal. He swans in from the right with panache, leaves Malone in his wake again, and curls a shot across Long and onto the far post. This time the ball bounces clear, rather than in. So unlucky, but what a sensational six minutes hes had! 50 min: Saville has tweaked something and cant continue. He trudges off glumly, to be replaced by Kieftenbeld. 48 min: That was a peach of a finish, though Malone may reflect that he backed off far too eagerly. Incidentally, Mateta was half a yard offside during the build-up, and in the Premier League, VAR would have almost certainly chalked that off. But theres no VAR here. A mere 47 seconds into the second half, Palace are level. And what an equaliser! Olise is given too much space down the right by Malone. He enters the box, switches his feet, and sends a glorious left-foot curler across Long and off the far post and in. The sweetest of strikes! Millwall get the second half underway. Some head tennis. No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Theres just enough time for Andersen and Hutchinson to grapple in the box, and for a frustrated Andersen to then shoulder charge Malone to the ground. And thats it for the first half. A good old-fashioned cup-tie, this, and its set up perfectly for the second half. 45 min +2: Another sliding tackle by Saville, and this one had to be perfectly timed, Eze preparing to meet Schlupps left-wing cross on the penalty spot. He whips the ball away from his toe from behind, and out for a corner. What a challenge! 45 min: Saville slides through the back of Andersen, who responds by cuffing his assailant around the ear as he falls. No action by the referee for that retro back-and-forth. All good clean filthy fun. 44 min: Ojo rampages down the right in style, and looks to be bodychecked by Tyrick Mitchell, but the referees having none of it. Ojo has looked very neat and tidy this afternoon. 42 min: Gallagher wins a free kick out on the left, then hoicks it straight out of play himself. He holds his hand up to apologise to all of his team-mates in Millwalls loaded box. 41 min: From the resulting free kick, Bradshaw bursts clear down the inside-right channel and finds himself in on goal. The flag pops up for offside. It turns out Bradshaw was onside, but theres no VAR, and Bradshaw fluffs the chance anyway. 40 min: Ojo skins Guehi down the right touchline, and is upended with a flick of the Palace defenders boot. Guehi is fortunate not to go into the book. 38 min: Palace are beginning to push Millwall back. Theyre not creating very much in the final third, but theyre taking a semblance of control. 36 min: Eze slaloms down the middle and briefly threatens to break into the Millwall box. He cant quite get through, but the ball breaks to Gallagher, who sends a curler towards the top left. The effort flies inches wide, and Long wasnt getting there. 35 min: Speaking of the length of the refs rope, the official comes across to the dugout to have a word with Patrick Vieira, who has been offering a critique of his work from a distance. No more than a lecture. 33 min: Tyrick Mitchell swings one in from the left. Long claims with ease, then faffs around theatrically before eventually kicking upfield. He might be testing the referees patience here. 31 min: This has become really scrappy again. Millwall will care not a jot. Palace cant find their groove at all, and the home side are looking comfortable right now. 29 min: Ward and Gallagher are discussions with the referee over something and nothing. Then Mateta taps his wrist in pantomime irritation as Long takes an age over a drop kick. Palace getting a little irritable. 27 min: Ojo busies himself down the left and wins a corner off Hughes. Malone takes. Its half cleared. Ojo, 30 yards out, whistles a shot straight at Butland, who gathers cleanly but is serenaded by saucy whistling anyway. 26 min: Schlupp is booked for some unspecified transgression of the rules. Arguing over the award of a Millwall free kick, possibly, McNamara having purchased a cheap one by getting in the way of Tyrick Mitchell. 25 min: The corner is no use. 24 min: Long finally warms his hands, parrying a swerving Schlupp shot that was heading into the top left. Corner. 23 min: Long takes his sweet time over the restart. The referee tells him to get an effing move on. Time-wasting at this stage is all a bit previous. 22 min: Bradshaw nudges Guehi to the floor, and its a free kick for Palace out on the left. Olise swings it into the mixer. Schlupp shanks a shot comfortably wide left. Long, getting a rare start in the Millwall goal, hasnt had anything to do yet. 20 min: Some minor redemption for Butland as he drops on a Saville snapshot towards the bottom right. 19 min: Butland has the good grace to look thoroughly embarrassed. The Millwall press was magnificent, Bradshaw and Afobe swarming the keeper, and attempting to play out from the back is an admirable pursuit, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and bash the ball away from danger. Oh dear Jack Butland. The Palace keeper has the ball at his feet, with Bradshaw and Afobe closing him down. Instead of blootering clear, he attempts to dribble between the two Millwall men. An absurd decision. Afobe nicks the ball off his toe and slots into the empty net. What a fiasco. The Championship club lead! 16 min: Nope. 15 min: Eze hassles Hutchinson and steals the ball, setting Palace on the attack. Schlupp wins a corner down the left. Can Palace trouble Millwall with their first corner of the game? 13 min: Savilles elbow did the damage, though the challenge looked accidental, the pair up in the air, contesting a high ball. Gallagher is good to continue, and the game restarts. 11 min: Gallagher is down, having taken a whack in the eye. On comes the physio to do his thing with latex gloves and cotton wool. 9 min: Bradshaw crosses from the left, and Afobe lashes a first-time snapshot wide left of goal from six yards. That was good play by Bradshaw, and a very decent chance to open the scoring. 7 min: Hughes goes sliding in on Ojo. He gets the ball, but follows through, his studs crumping on Ojos leg. Fortunately Ojo isnt hurt, but that wasnt clever. Youve seen players booked for much less. Theres even a case for a red. But here we are. No free kick. 6 min: Both teams snap into a few tackles. Its pretty shapeless, as everyone finds their feet. The fans still give it everything, atmosphere beating product right now. 4 min: Otherwise, its been a scrappy start. All very hectic. 2 min: Millwall are on the front foot immediately, and win a corner down the right. Malone swings it in fiercely, and it looks like nestling into the top left, with Butland beaten all ends up. But the ball clips the top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick. What a start that would have been! Palace get the ball rolling ... but only after taking the knee. Millwall, who have their own anti-racism initiatives, choose to stand. The home fans give the visitors the bird. Down pours the rain, and out come the teams. Millwall wear their dark blue, while Palace are sporting blue-and-white halves, a shirt inspired by the clubs first-ever kit, and one they sported while getting to the semi-finals of the very first FA Cup in 1871-72. The home side are also celebrating 150 years of the cup with this delicious retro programme. A rare old atmosphere at the Den, as youd expect. Well be off in a couple of minutes! Millwall boss Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. Were confident in our team. Were playing a side that has a lot of quality in forward areas, so a large part of our game is how we deal with their attacking numbers. We know it will be a good test. You have to relish these games, its what football is about. Theres no Jed Wallace or Murray Wallace for Millwall, but George Long gets a go in goal. First-choice keeper Bartosz Bialkowski is on the bench alongside 15-year-old striker Zak Lovelace, an FA Cup fairytale waiting to be told. Conor Gallagher and Ebere Eze are back for Crystal Palace, who make five changes this afternoon. Patrick Vieira has also recalled Jack Butland, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Luka Milivojevic, Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard drop to the bench. Millwall: Long, Hutchinson, Pearce, Cooper, McNamara, Mitchell, Saville, Afobe, Ojo, Bradshaw, Malone. Subs: Kieftenbeld, Smith, Bennett, Evans, Burey, Bialkowski, Boateng, Topalloj, Lovelace. Crystal Palace: Butland, Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell, Schlupp, Gallagher, Hughes, Eze, Mateta, Olise. Subs: Milivojevic, Clyne, Matthews, Benteke, Edouard, Kelly, Riedewald, Rak-Sakyi, Wells-Morrison. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Its a big South London derby laden with expectation, as Millwall face Crystal Palace for the first time in nine years. These two great rivals have had even longer to wait for an FA Cup showdown: its 37 years since George Grahams Lions won a third-round replay at Selhurst Park after a 1-1 draw at the Den. Neither club has ever won the famous old trophy, but theyve both come close, and both have Manchester United to blame for their cup-final heartbreak, Millwall losing to the Red Devils in 2004, Palace in 1990 and 2016. With Millwall chasing a play-off spot in the Championship, and Palace fairly comfortable in the Premier League, both teams will fancy their chances of another famous cup run. Kick off is at 12.45pm, with extra time and penalties to follow should the match end in a draw. Its on!

Ed Aarons was our man at the Den this afternoon. His report has landed, so get clicking, good people. Thanks for reading this MBM. Patrick Vieira talks to the telly. I was happy with the first half but we didnt use the ball well enough. In the second half, we wanted to win the game to support Jack, because this is the way we want to play and sometimes you make mistakes, but I was really pleased with the character we showed in the second half. We changed the shape in the second half so Olise was wider, and we created a situation where he was in a one versus one. He showed his quality. Gary Rowett speaks to ITV. I thought we were pretty good for most of the game. On and off the ball, we were excellent. We conceded a really poor goal in the 46th minute. Olise is a good player and you have to force him onto his right foot. The second goal, again, its a ball in the box and a header we have to mark. You cant give two goals to a Premier League side, and thats a disappointment. The outstanding Michael Olise, who has unsurprisingly been named man of the match, speaks to ITV: It was a tough start to the game. Balls going in the air, fighting. At half-time we said we needed to respond and show our fight, and thats what we did in the second half. I feel good. Our quality came through. Our manager said to express ourselves, and thats what we did. The fans have been great, the atmosphere was great. Palace were much improved in the second half. Michael Olise, who scored one, set up another, and hit the post in a wild 13-minute creative burst, was nothing short of sensational. His actions will have spoilt the day of the piece of work who hit him on the head with a bottle of pop; youve gotta love karma. Jack Butland, who gifted Millwall the lead in the first half, probably owes him a debt of gratitude too. The whistle goes, and Crystal Palace are in the hat for the fourth round. 90 min +5: Nope! One more! Space for Bennett down the right. He hooks in for Smith, who rises above Andersen, six yards out, but sends a weak header straight at Butland. That was a great chance for the big man. 90 min +4: Hutchinson meets the corner with a weak header. Butland flops on the ball, and Millwalls last chance may have come and gone. 90 min +3: The free kicks sent wide right to Burey, who fizzes a fine low cross through the six-yard box. Any touch, and its in. It somehow evades everyone in the middle, and finally deflects out for a corner. 90 min +2: Gallagher steps across Burey and thats a free kick for Millwall in Palace territory.

My friend Allan Wilmot, who has died aged 96, was one of the oldest surviving Caribbean second world war veterans. Allan was unusual as a black serviceman during the conflict because he served in both the Royal Navy and the RAF. The youngest of five children, he was born to a middle-class family in Kingston, Jamaica, which was then under British colonial rule. His father, Charles, was the captain of a merchant navy ship. His mother, Alice, brought up Allan and his three sisters and brother and did voluntary work in the community. In his 2015 autobiography Now You Know, Allan wrote: I soon became aware of the poverty that many other Jamaicans families experienced. From Wesley school, Allan won a scholarship to Wolmers high school. Aged 16 he volunteered for the Royal Navy in 1941, responding to an advertisement for recruits in the Jamaican Daily Gleaner newspaper. He served on HMS Hauken in Caribbean waters where German submarines lurked, sinking many British ships. Allan starred in my 2015 BBC TV film Fighting for King and Empire, Britains Caribbean Heroes, and he told me his search and rescue team pulled hundreds of sailors out of the sea. Because his naval career was not progressing, in 1943 Allan heeded the call for Jamaican and other Caribbeans to join the RAF. After the war, in 1947 he docked in Southampton on the HMS Almanzora, then made his way to London, living for a while in an abandoned railway carriage and washing dishes at the Cumberland hotel in Marble Arch. He was joined the following year by his brother Harry, who sailed on the Empire Windrush. In the early 1950s they both became members of a soulful singing group, the Southlanders, which was the first of its kind to achieve widespread success in Britain and the longest-running black British hitmakers in the 1950s. Their cover version of Alone (Why Must I Be Alone), which sold more than a million copies and got to No 2 in 1957, was their biggest seller. The 1958 novelty song The Mole in a Hole, is, perhaps, the best remembered, with its line I am a Mole and I Live in a Hole sung by Harry (whose son, Gary, also went on to be an entertainer). Allan bought a new convertible car with his first royalty cheque. After leaving the Southlanders in 1974, Allan became a Post Office telephone operator. Five years later, he was promoted to assistant supervisor at the Balham telephone exchange. He helped set up the West Indian Ex-Servicemens Association, which originally met at the YMCA in central Londons Tottenham Court Road in the early 1970s, and then moved to its own building at Clapham, in south London. Its now known as the West Indian Association of Service Personnel. Allan was proud that, as a war veteran, he went to Buckingham Palace several times to meet the Queen and Prince Charles - the photographs had pride of place on the memorabilia-adorned living room wall of his home in Gipsy Hill, south London. Allans wife, Joyce (nee Fletcher), whom he married in 1966, died in 2020. He is survived by four daughters, Alison, Sandra, Audrey and Michelle.

My friend Allan Wilmot, who has died aged 96, was one of the oldest surviving Caribbean second world war veterans. Allan was unusual as a black serviceman during the conflict because he served in both the Royal Navy and the RAF. The youngest of five children, he was born to a middle-class family in Kingston, Jamaica, which was then under British colonial rule. His father, Charles, was the captain of a merchant navy ship. His mother, Alice, brought up Allan and his three sisters and brother and did voluntary work in the community. In his 2015 autobiography Now You Know, Allan wrote: I soon became aware of the poverty that many other Jamaicans families experienced. From Wesley school, Allan won a scholarship to Wolmers high school. Aged 16 he volunteered for the Royal Navy in 1941, responding to an advertisement for recruits in the Jamaican Daily Gleaner newspaper. He served on HMS Hauken in Caribbean waters where German submarines lurked, sinking many British ships. Allan starred in my 2015 BBC TV film Fighting for King and Empire, Britains Caribbean Heroes, and he told me his search and rescue team pulled hundreds of sailors out of the sea. Because his naval career was not progressing, in 1943 Allan heeded the call for Jamaican and other Caribbeans to join the RAF. After the war, in 1947 he docked in Southampton on the HMS Almanzora, then made his way to London, living for a while in an abandoned railway carriage and washing dishes at the Cumberland hotel in Marble Arch. He was joined the following year by his brother Harry, who sailed on the Empire Windrush. In the early 1950s they both became members of a soulful singing group, the Southlanders, which was the first of its kind to achieve widespread success in Britain and the longest-running black British hitmakers in the 1950s. Their cover version of Alone (Why Must I Be Alone), which sold more than a million copies and got to No 2 in 1957, was their biggest seller. The 1958 novelty song The Mole in a Hole, is, perhaps, the best remembered, with its line I am a Mole and I Live in a Hole sung by Harry (whose son, Gary, also went on to be an entertainer). Allan bought a new convertible car with his first royalty cheque. After leaving the Southlanders in 1974, Allan became a Post Office telephone operator. Five years later, he was promoted to assistant supervisor at the Balham telephone exchange. He helped set up the West Indian Ex-Servicemens Association, which originally met at the YMCA in central Londons Tottenham Court Road in the early 1970s, and then moved to its own building at Clapham, in south London. Its now known as the West Indian Association of Service Personnel. Allan was proud that, as a war veteran, he went to Buckingham Palace several times to meet the Queen and Prince Charles - the photographs had pride of place on the memorabilia-adorned living room wall of his home in Gipsy Hill, south London. Allans wife, Joyce (nee Fletcher), whom he married in 1966, died in 2020. He is survived by four daughters, Alison, Sandra, Audrey and Michelle.

My friend Allan Wilmot, who has died aged 96, was one of the oldest surviving Caribbean second world war veterans. Allan was unusual as a black serviceman during the conflict because he served in both the Royal Navy and the RAF. The youngest of five children, he was born to a middle-class family in Kingston, Jamaica, which was then under British colonial rule. His father, Charles, was the captain of a merchant navy ship. His mother, Alice, brought up Allan and his three sisters and brother and did voluntary work in the community. In his 2015 autobiography Now You Know, Allan wrote: I soon became aware of the poverty that many other Jamaicans families experienced. From Wesley school, Allan won a scholarship to Wolmers high school. Aged 16 he volunteered for the Royal Navy in 1941, responding to an advertisement for recruits in the Jamaican Daily Gleaner newspaper. He served on HMS Hauken in Caribbean waters where German submarines lurked, sinking many British ships. Allan starred in my 2015 BBC TV film Fighting for King and Empire, Britains Caribbean Heroes, and he told me his search and rescue team pulled hundreds of sailors out of the sea. Because his naval career was not progressing, in 1943 Allan heeded the call for Jamaican and other Caribbeans to join the RAF. After the war, in 1947 he docked in Southampton on the HMS Almanzora, then made his way to London, living for a while in an abandoned railway carriage and washing dishes at the Cumberland hotel in Marble Arch. He was joined the following year by his brother Harry, who sailed on the Empire Windrush. In the early 1950s they both became members of a soulful singing group, the Southlanders, which was the first of its kind to achieve widespread success in Britain and the longest-running black British hitmakers in the 1950s. Their cover version of Alone (Why Must I Be Alone), which sold more than a million copies and got to No 2 in 1957, was their biggest seller. The 1958 novelty song The Mole in a Hole, is, perhaps, the best remembered, with its line I am a Mole and I Live in a Hole sung by Harry (whose son, Gary, also went on to be an entertainer). Allan bought a new convertible car with his first royalty cheque. After leaving the Southlanders in 1974, Allan became a Post Office telephone operator. Five years later, he was promoted to assistant supervisor at the Balham telephone exchange. He helped set up the West Indian Ex-Servicemens Association, which originally met at the YMCA in central Londons Tottenham Court Road in the early 1970s, and then moved to its own building at Clapham, in south London.

Allan bought a new convertible car with his first royalty cheque. After leaving the Southlanders in 1974, Allan became a Post Office telephone operator. Five years later, he was promoted to assistant supervisor at the Balham telephone exchange. He helped set up the West Indian Ex-Servicemens Association, which originally met at the YMCA in central Londons Tottenham Court Road in the early 1970s, and then moved to its own building at Clapham, in south London. Its now known as the West Indian Association of Service Personnel. Allan was proud that, as a war veteran, he went to Buckingham Palace several times to meet the Queen and Prince Charles - the photographs had pride of place on the memorabilia-adorned living room wall of his home in Gipsy Hill, south London. Allans wife, Joyce (nee Fletcher), whom he married in 1966, died in 2020. He is survived by four daughters, Alison, Sandra, Audrey and Michelle.

My friend Allan Wilmot, who has died aged 96, was one of the oldest surviving Caribbean second world war veterans. Allan was unusual as a black serviceman during the conflict because he served in both the Royal Navy and the RAF. The youngest of five children, he was born to a middle-class family in Kingston, Jamaica, which was then under British colonial rule. His father, Charles, was the captain of a merchant navy ship. His mother, Alice, brought up Allan and his three sisters and brother and did voluntary work in the community. In his 2015 autobiography Now You Know, Allan wrote: I soon became aware of the poverty that many other Jamaicans families experienced. From Wesley school, Allan won a scholarship to Wolmers high school. Aged 16 he volunteered for the Royal Navy in 1941, responding to an advertisement for recruits in the Jamaican Daily Gleaner newspaper. He served on HMS Hauken in Caribbean waters where German submarines lurked, sinking many British ships. Allan starred in my 2015 BBC TV film Fighting for King and Empire, Britains Caribbean Heroes, and he told me his search and rescue team pulled hundreds of sailors out of the sea. Because his naval career was not progressing, in 1943 Allan heeded the call for Jamaican and other Caribbeans to join the RAF. After the war, in 1947 he docked in Southampton on the HMS Almanzora, then made his way to London, living for a while in an abandoned railway carriage and washing dishes at the Cumberland hotel in Marble Arch. He was joined the following year by his brother Harry, who sailed on the Empire Windrush. In the early 1950s they both became members of a soulful singing group, the Southlanders, which was the first of its kind to achieve widespread success in Britain and the longest-running black British hitmakers in the 1950s. Their cover version of Alone (Why Must I Be Alone), which sold more than a million copies and got to No 2 in 1957, was their biggest seller. The 1958 novelty song The Mole in a Hole, is, perhaps, the best remembered, with its line I am a Mole and I Live in a Hole sung by Harry (whose son, Gary, also went on to be an entertainer).

In the period following the explosion begun by Marvel Comics in the 1960s and accelerated by the campy Batman TV series in the middle of the decade, Neal Adams, who has died aged 80 of complications from sepsis, was one of the greatest, and probably most influential, artists in comics. Adams was central to the rethinking of characters including Marvels X-Men and, for their rival DC Comics, the Spectre, Deadman and, most crucially, the Batman. He also brought about changes to business practices, most notably winning artists the right to their original artwork, and getting long-delayed credit and compensation in the 1980s for the Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. He reinvented the look of comic pages and characters, said the writer Neil Gaiman. He was the reason I drew Batman in every school exercise book. Adams combined the powerful dynamism and expressionist movement of early Marvels two masters, Jack Kirby (Fantastic Four, Captain America) and Steve Ditko (Spider Man, Doctor Strange). But his work, influenced by the limitations of four-panel daily comics and glossy ad work, also displayed the more romantic attractiveness usually offered by less dramatic artists. His characters could be as muscular as Frank Frazettas barbarians and as appealing as Alex Raymonds daily strips, but they soared through the panels, every movement telling the story  he was always cinematically aware of the viewers place outside the page. Adams knew early he wanted to draw comics. He was born on Governors Island, New York, where his father, Frank, was stationed with the US army. He grew up on bases, including in Germany, but his father was not heavily involved in his upbringing. His mother, Liliane, worked in a shoe factory and for the national phone company, and ran a boarding house. When his father left, Neal worked on the Coney Island boardwalk, near their home, to help support his mother. He went to the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan, leaving in 1959, and then sent his work to DC, who rejected it. When he took it to Archie Comics, the editor Joe Simon (co-creator of Captain America) told him not to ruin his life in the business. Nevertheless, Adams drew sample pages for Archies nascent superhero, the Fly, and some of the work was used. He was hired, but to draw comic fillers for Archies Joke Book. After this, he assisted Howard Nostrand, mostly drawing backgrounds on his daily newspaper strip, Bat Masterson, then worked in advertising before getting his own strip in 1962: Ben Casey  like Masterson based on a successful TV series. It ran until 1966. Though daily strips tended to soap opera, Casey, about a hospital surgeon, touched on contemporary issues. In 1967 he began drawing stories for Creepy and Eerie, black-and-white magazines emulating the 1950s EC horror comics. When DCs Joe Kubert began drawing the Tales of the Green Beret daily strip, Adams was hired to replace him on DCs war comics, yet soon found himself working on Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope comics. But his spectacular cover for The Brave and the Bold featuring Batman and the Spectre led to more work on superheroes, including a remarkable sequence on Deadman. Deadman had been co-created by Carmine Infantino, who was now DCs publisher. He called Adams his sparkplug. This may explain why Adams was one of the few people to freelance for DC and Marvel simultaneously. In 1969 he and the Marvel writer Roy Thomas tried to revive the failing X-Men book. Their run lasted only nine issues before cancellation, but they brought back Professor X, and when the series was revived in 1975 theirs was the template it followed. Adams, Thomas and the inker Tom Palmer brought The Avengers to new heights with the Kree-Skrull War series (1971-72). But his key partnership occurred back at DC, with the writer Dennis ONeil, with whom he had also worked at Marvel. They recaptured the Batman from the TV series camp Pow! Wham! characterisation, creating more realism and more menace, and helping bring the DC line back to relevance. Their new characters, especially the Fu Manchu-like villain Ras Al Ghul, who first appeared in 1971, and his femme fatale daughter Talia, and their recreation of the Joker in 1973 as a psychopathic killer, set the bar for future reinterpretations. They also redid the awkward pairing of Green Lantern and Green Arrow with a story arc including the discovery that the Arrows sidekick, Speedy, had become a junkie. Besides having contemporary resonance, it was arguably the first comic storyline to examine the now-familiar paradox of the inability of superheroes to actually change the world. Dissatisfied with both the artistic and economic strictures of comic books, Adams and the DC artist and editor Dick Giordano formed their own studio, Continuity Associates, in 1978. His final story for DC was one of his favourites, Superman Vs Muhammad Ali (1978), with its famous cover containing dozens of celebrities (and colleagues) at ringside. His company moved in new directions, primarily providing storyboards for movies, but also into animation, game design, computer graphics and advertising. Adams could be a hard teacher, but he was also a supportive resource, whose wide respect in the field opened doors for newcomers. The artists gathered around Continuity Associates also packaged comics for the big companies; they were known as Crusty Bunkers. One of the most famous Bunkers, Denys Cowan, called Adams his second dad. Adams himself illustrated books and worked for some new independent publishers. For years he battled the big companies to establish copyright for artists; in 1987 he won a court decision that denied copyright but compelled the return of original art. Along with the golden age artist Jerry Robinson and the lawyer Ed Priess, he won Siegel, Shuster and their families recognition and royalties from DC just as the Superman franchise was becoming huge. In 2005, he returned to comics, later writing and drawing the miniseries Batman: Odyssey (2010) for DC and The First X-Men (2013) for Marvel. In 2008, Adams worked with the David S Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, Washington, lobbying the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum to return Dina Babbitts original artwork, drawn to illustrate Dr Josef Mengeles racial theories in order to save herself and her daughter from the gas chambers. He illustrated, with Kubert, a six-page story about Babbitt, with a foreword by Stan Lee; two years later he illustrated and narrated a Disney series, They Spoke Out: American Voices Against the Holocaust. Adams is survived by his second wife, Marilyn, whom he married in 1987, and their son, Josh, and by his daughters, Kris and Zeea, and sons, Joel and Jason, from his first marriage, to Cory Adams, a comics colourist, which ended in divorce.  Neal Adams, artist, born 15 June 1941; died 28 April 2022

In the period following the explosion begun by Marvel Comics in the 1960s and accelerated by the campy Batman TV series in the middle of the decade, Neal Adams, who has died aged 80 of complications from sepsis, was one of the greatest, and probably most influential, artists in comics. Adams was central to the rethinking of characters including Marvels X-Men and, for their rival DC Comics, the Spectre, Deadman and, most crucially, the Batman. He also brought about changes to business practices, most notably winning artists the right to their original artwork, and getting long-delayed credit and compensation in the 1980s for the Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. He reinvented the look of comic pages and characters, said the writer Neil Gaiman. He was the reason I drew Batman in every school exercise book. Adams combined the powerful dynamism and expressionist movement of early Marvels two masters, Jack Kirby (Fantastic Four, Captain America) and Steve Ditko (Spider Man, Doctor Strange). But his work, influenced by the limitations of four-panel daily comics and glossy ad work, also displayed the more romantic attractiveness usually offered by less dramatic artists. His characters could be as muscular as Frank Frazettas barbarians and as appealing as Alex Raymonds daily strips, but they soared through the panels, every movement telling the story  he was always cinematically aware of the viewers place outside the page. Adams knew early he wanted to draw comics. He was born on Governors Island, New York, where his father, Frank, was stationed with the US army. He grew up on bases, including in Germany, but his father was not heavily involved in his upbringing. His mother, Liliane, worked in a shoe factory and for the national phone company, and ran a boarding house. When his father left, Neal worked on the Coney Island boardwalk, near their home, to help support his mother. He went to the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan, leaving in 1959, and then sent his work to DC, who rejected it. When he took it to Archie Comics, the editor Joe Simon (co-creator of Captain America) told him not to ruin his life in the business. Nevertheless, Adams drew sample pages for Archies nascent superhero, the Fly, and some of the work was used. He was hired, but to draw comic fillers for Archies Joke Book. After this, he assisted Howard Nostrand, mostly drawing backgrounds on his daily newspaper strip, Bat Masterson, then worked in advertising before getting his own strip in 1962: Ben Casey  like Masterson based on a successful TV series. It ran until 1966. Though daily strips tended to soap opera, Casey, about a hospital surgeon, touched on contemporary issues. In 1967 he began drawing stories for Creepy and Eerie, black-and-white magazines emulating the 1950s EC horror comics. When DCs Joe Kubert began drawing the Tales of the Green Beret daily strip, Adams was hired to replace him on DCs war comics, yet soon found himself working on Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope comics. But his spectacular cover for The Brave and the Bold featuring Batman and the Spectre led to more work on superheroes, including a remarkable sequence on Deadman. Deadman had been co-created by Carmine Infantino, who was now DCs publisher. He called Adams his sparkplug. This may explain why Adams was one of the few people to freelance for DC and Marvel simultaneously. In 1969 he and the Marvel writer Roy Thomas tried to revive the failing X-Men book. Their run lasted only nine issues before cancellation, but they brought back Professor X, and when the series was revived in 1975 theirs was the template it followed. Adams, Thomas and the inker Tom Palmer brought The Avengers to new heights with the Kree-Skrull War series (1971-72). But his key partnership occurred back at DC, with the writer Dennis ONeil, with whom he had also worked at Marvel. They recaptured the Batman from the TV series camp Pow! Wham! characterisation, creating more realism and more menace, and helping bring the DC line back to relevance. Their new characters, especially the Fu Manchu-like villain Ras Al Ghul, who first appeared in 1971, and his femme fatale daughter Talia, and their recreation of the Joker in 1973 as a psychopathic killer, set the bar for future reinterpretations. They also redid the awkward pairing of Green Lantern and Green Arrow with a story arc including the discovery that the Arrows sidekick, Speedy, had become a junkie. Besides having contemporary resonance, it was arguably the first comic storyline to examine the now-familiar paradox of the inability of superheroes to actually change the world. Dissatisfied with both the artistic and economic strictures of comic books, Adams and the DC artist and editor Dick Giordano formed their own studio, Continuity Associates, in 1978. His final story for DC was one of his favourites, Superman Vs Muhammad Ali (1978), with its famous cover containing dozens of celebrities (and colleagues) at ringside. His company moved in new directions, primarily providing storyboards for movies, but also into animation, game design, computer graphics and advertising. Adams could be a hard teacher, but he was also a supportive resource, whose wide respect in the field opened doors for newcomers. The artists gathered around Continuity Associates also packaged comics for the big companies; they were known as Crusty Bunkers. One of the most famous Bunkers, Denys Cowan, called Adams his second dad. Adams himself illustrated books and worked for some new independent publishers. For years he battled the big companies to establish copyright for artists; in 1987 he won a court decision that denied copyright but compelled the return of original art. Along with the golden age artist Jerry Robinson and the lawyer Ed Priess, he won Siegel, Shuster and their families recognition and royalties from DC just as the Superman franchise was becoming huge. In 2005, he returned to comics, later writing and drawing the miniseries Batman: Odyssey (2010) for DC and The First X-Men (2013) for Marvel. In 2008, Adams worked with the David S Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, Washington, lobbying the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum to return Dina Babbitts original artwork, drawn to illustrate Dr Josef Mengeles racial theories in order to save herself and her daughter from the gas chambers. He illustrated, with Kubert, a six-page story about Babbitt, with a foreword by Stan Lee; two years later he illustrated and narrated a Disney series, They Spoke Out: American Voices Against the Holocaust. Adams is survived by his second wife, Marilyn, whom he married in 1987, and their son, Josh, and by his daughters, Kris and Zeea, and sons, Joel and Jason, from his first marriage, to Cory Adams, a comics colourist, which ended in divorce.

A lot can change in a week in football but for Sean Dyche the problem was a lack of change in a decade at Turf Moor. His methods were tried and tested: play 4-4-2 and finish 17th or above. Dyche was the master of keeping unfashionable Burnley in the Premier League but the faith of the players and owners ran out. Ten of the squad that beat Chelsea on the opening day of the 2017-18 season and took them to a seventh-placed finish are still at the club. Some would see it as a sign of stability but others would argue the team have not evolved in that time, when the plan rarely changed week-to-week and season-to-season. Senior players grew frustrated that areas of weakness were not addressed in recent years, leaving the squad short of depth and in need of revitalising. Players such as Phil Bardsley have been kept on, rather than being replaced. Bardsley has appeared four times in two seasons in the Premier League, and not since February 2021. Dyche has not called on him in the league this season despite naming him on the bench on 24 occasions. It spoke volumes that with Ben Mee and Nathan Collins absent through injury and suspension respectively, the 31-year-old Kevin Long was asked to make his first appearance in 14 months for the club in the recent loss to Manchester City. Loyalty to players has always been important to Dyche but without Chris Wood his limited striking options have been highlighted. Ashley Barnes joined in 2014 and has a scoring record of less than one in every five games, including no goals this season; Matej Vydras best season at Burnley has brought him a grand total of three goals; Jay Rodriguez hit one in 31 appearances last season, following it up with two in 26 this time; and Wout Weghorst has one in 12 since joining in January. While the defence have kept their end of the bargain with seven clean sheets, the strikers have repeatedly fallen short in recent times, another source of frustration in the team. Dyche struggled to rally the players for a fourth relegation battle in six years, securing no wins between the end of October and mid-February. The teams predictability was becoming a problem as other clubs evolved and spent more money to improve their sides while progress was limited at Turf Moor. Despite the poor results, the style and formation were kept the same with the confidence that it would eventually come good despite evidence to the contrary, leaving players disillusioned. The blame cannot be laid purely at Dyches door given that he worked within set parameters. Despite the takeover by ALK Capital last year, a deal which left the club 90m worse off, the budget has remained limited. Money has been spent on Collins, Connor Roberts, Maxwel Cornet and Weghorst, who was signed as a replacement for Wood. Newcastle paid 25m for Wood but Weghorst cost less than half that and was the only January arrival despite Burnleys struggles. Other players were targeted but the club failed to get deals over the line, much to the chagrin of many at Turf Moor, leaving them light for the battle they face. Even in 2020-21 the only first-team player to sign was the central midfielder Dale Stephens, who has been unable to become a regular. Dyche leaves Burnley four points from a safe position with eight games to go after a pitiful loss against the Championship-bound Norwich. The problems of the club were laid bare at Carrow Road, where Weghorst was taken off after 56 ineffectual minutes to be replaced by Vydra, who has scored seven league goals in three and a half seasons at the club. Unsurprisingly, Burnley did not get back into the game; they managed four shots on target against a side who have conceded 63 times this season, to leave the players dejected for the final time under Dyche. The next manager will inherit a squad in Dyches mould and have to reinvigorate it in a short space of time. It is unlikely the style and formation will change much but a fresh approach in the dressing room is much wanted and needed with survival on the line. Dyches impact will not be forgotten. Two promotions and European qualification will be the on-pitch legacy that he leaves. Away from it, helping Burnley become a relatively stable Premier League side has allowed them to invest in a new training ground and he will forever be welcome in The Royal Dyche pub in the town. Sometimes change is good but Burnley cannot stop with the one in the dugout.

Unsurprisingly, Burnley did not get back into the game; they managed four shots on target against a side who have conceded 63 times this season, to leave the players dejected for the final time under Dyche. The next manager will inherit a squad in Dyches mould and have to reinvigorate it in a short space of time. It is unlikely the style and formation will change much but a fresh approach in the dressing room is much wanted and needed with survival on the line. Dyches impact will not be forgotten. Two promotions and European qualification will be the on-pitch legacy that he leaves. Away from it, helping Burnley become a relatively stable Premier League side has allowed them to invest in a new training ground and he will forever be welcome in The Royal Dyche pub in the town. Sometimes change is good but Burnley cannot stop with the one in the dugout.

A lot can change in a week in football but for Sean Dyche the problem was a lack of change in a decade at Turf Moor. His methods were tried and tested: play 4-4-2 and finish 17th or above. Dyche was the master of keeping unfashionable Burnley in the Premier League but the faith of the players and owners ran out. Ten of the squad that beat Chelsea on the opening day of the 2017-18 season and took them to a seventh-placed finish are still at the club. Some would see it as a sign of stability but others would argue the team have not evolved in that time, when the plan rarely changed week-to-week and season-to-season. Senior players grew frustrated that areas of weakness were not addressed in recent years, leaving the squad short of depth and in need of revitalising. Players such as Phil Bardsley have been kept on, rather than being replaced. Bardsley has appeared four times in two seasons in the Premier League, and not since February 2021. Dyche has not called on him in the league this season despite naming him on the bench on 24 occasions. It spoke volumes that with Ben Mee and Nathan Collins absent through injury and suspension respectively, the 31-year-old Kevin Long was asked to make his first appearance in 14 months for the club in the recent loss to Manchester City. Loyalty to players has always been important to Dyche but without Chris Wood his limited striking options have been highlighted. Ashley Barnes joined in 2014 and has a scoring record of less than one in every five games, including no goals this season; Matej Vydras best season at Burnley has brought him a grand total of three goals; Jay Rodriguez hit one in 31 appearances last season, following it up with two in 26 this time; and Wout Weghorst has one in 12 since joining in January. While the defence have kept their end of the bargain with seven clean sheets, the strikers have repeatedly fallen short in recent times, another source of frustration in the team. Dyche struggled to rally the players for a fourth relegation battle in six years, securing no wins between the end of October and mid-February. The teams predictability was becoming a problem as other clubs evolved and spent more money to improve their sides while progress was limited at Turf Moor. Despite the poor results, the style and formation were kept the same with the confidence that it would eventually come good despite evidence to the contrary, leaving players disillusioned. The blame cannot be laid purely at Dyches door given that he worked within set parameters. Despite the takeover by ALK Capital last year, a deal which left the club 90m worse off, the budget has remained limited. Money has been spent on Collins, Connor Roberts, Maxwel Cornet and Weghorst, who was signed as a replacement for Wood. Newcastle paid 25m for Wood but Weghorst cost less than half that and was the only January arrival despite Burnleys struggles. Other players were targeted but the club failed to get deals over the line, much to the chagrin of many at Turf Moor, leaving them light for the battle they face. Even in 2020-21 the only first-team player to sign was the central midfielder Dale Stephens, who has been unable to become a regular.

Marcus Rashford is considering his future at Manchester United after growing unhappy with his game time under Ralf Rangnick. The forward hopes the situation will improve but is giving serious consideration for the first time to asking for a move from his boyhood club. Since Rashford played the whole of Uniteds draw at Newcastle on 27 December, he has started two of the teams 11 Premier League matches. On one occasion he was unavailable because of injury, twice he was an unused substitute and Sundays 4-1 defeat at Manchester City was his sixth appearance from the bench in that period. Although Rashford started the Champions League last-16 first leg at Atltico Madrid and the FA Cup ties against Aston Villa and Middlesbrough  Uniteds three other matches this year  he is frustrated at not playing more. He missed the opening two months of the season because of a shoulder operation. The 24-year-old has a contract to 2023 and the club are understood to have an option to extend for a further year. Rashford, who has spent his whole career with United, has fallen behind Anthony Elanga in Rangnicks thinking. Rangnick is in interim charge until the end of the season and Rashford must weigh up whether he thinks the picture will improve for him under the next manager. The England international would welcome any clarity the club can provide. There is no guarantee United would accede to any transfer request, with Rashford one of their most valuable assets. United are fully engaged in their search for a permanent manager, with Paris Saint-Germains Mauricio Pochettino having slipped from being the favoured candidate to being ranked alongside Ajaxs Erik ten Hag. Although United are not restricting their shortlist to that pair, the title defence of Ajax, they lead the Eredivisie by two points with nine matches left, has increased admiration at the club for the 52-year-old. Pochettino remains a strong candidate  and he is seriously interested in the job  although United are worried that it may be difficult to extract him from PSG. Pochettino has guided PSG to the top of Ligue 1  13 points clear of second-placed Nice, who beat them on Saturday  and is under contract until 2023. The attitude of the PSG hierarchy is that Pochettino will fulfil his contract unless they decide to sack him  in other words, he leaves only on their terms. They are not about to lose face by allowing him to walk out to join another high-profile club. Pochettino knows, fairly or otherwise, he will be judged at PSG on whether he can win the Champions League. His team go to Real Madrid on Wednesday for the second leg of their last-16 tie with a 1-0 lead. The United executive have been in contact with Pochettino and Ten Hag. Uniteds defeat at City came after they were competitive before the interval, trailing 2-1 at half-time, but then capitulated, with City able to attack at will. This caused criticism that Uniteds players had given up. Citys Kevin De Bruyne, who scored twice and was replaced towards the end, denied this. When you play a pressing style its very hard to adjust to it so maybe it seemed like they did give up a little  because its very hard to do it for 90 minutes as a team, he said. I was watching the last 10 minutes and it felt like they were a little bit out [of energy], so the spaces got a bit bigger. I wouldnt necessarily say that they gave up  its hard to say that. It might have looked comfortable but its hard work. United set up [to do] more pressing but in the second half we found the spaces.

Shane Warne, the greatest leg-spinner in the history of cricket and an Australian icon who transcended the sport, has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 52. The news was confirmed by Warnes management company on Friday and released initially to Fox Sports, the network for whom he commentated after a playing career that returned 708 Test wickets from 145 caps between 1992 and 2007. A statement from MPC entertainment to the UK media said: It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack in Koh Samui, Thailand today, Friday 4 March. Shane was found unresponsive in his villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived. The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course. Coming just 24 hours after Australian cricket had lost former wicketkeeper Rod Marsh to a heart attack aged 74, news of Warnes passing left supporters, former teammates and opponents shocked and numb as tributes flowed on social media. Warne himself had paid tribute to Marsh. Members of the current Australia team learned of the news while travelling back from day one of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. David Warner, the opener, tweeted: Two legends of our game have left us too soon. Im lost for words, and this is extremely sad. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Marsh and Warne family. I just cannot believe it. rip, you will both be missed. Viv Richards, the former West Indies captain who like Warne was named one of Wisdens five cricketers of the 20th century, tweeted: Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This cant be true. Rest In Peace, @ShaneWarne. There are no words to describe what I feel right now. A huge loss for cricket. The numbers from Warnes playing days were remarkable, his 708 Test wickets second only to Sri Lankas Muttiah Muraliathan (800) and his 194 one-day internationals returning 293 victims and a World Cup winners medal in 1999. Though the rise of the Twenty20 format came after his international career, he played in the Indian Premier League, captaining Rajasthan Royals to the title in 2008, and played five seasons for Hampshire in English county cricket between 2000 and 2007. But the figures also scarcely tell the story of a cricketer who transformed the art of leg-spin after making his Test debut against India aged 22 despite just seven first-class matches for Victoria. Though Warnes start was underwhelming, the following year he truly announced himself on the world stage when his first delivery in Ashes cricket  the Ball of the Century  bowled a bamboozled Englands Mike Gatting at Old Trafford. Warne went on to leave an indelible mark on the storied history of the rivalry between the two nations, playing a role in six successive Ashes series wins and then producing arguably his finest performance  40 wickets, despite off-field marriage problems  during the famous 2005 series that saw England end 16 years of Australian dominance. In 1998 it emerged that Warne and Mark Waugh had been fined four years earlier for providing information to an Indian bookmaker during Australias tour of Sri Lanka. But his darkest cricketing moment came when he was suspended from all cricket for 12 months before the start of the 2003 World Cup after testing positive for a diuretic. Bowing out from international cricket after the 2006-07 Ashes, the urn safely reclaimed with a 5-0 whitewash, Warne was one of the most astute tacticians in the game; the greatest captain Australia never had, went the oft-said phrase about a cricketing brain that always crackled with ideas and theories. This carried through to his post-playing days as a commentator for Sky in the UK and Fox Sports in Australia, so too the mischievous, larrikin character that generated headlines at both the front and back of newspapers and proved so popular with the sporting public. He was engaged to the actor Liz Hurley in 2010, a relationship that ended in 2013. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, was among those who paid tribute to Warne, saying: We have lost one of Australias greatest cricketers and today we are bewildered by this sad and sudden loss. Warnes family has been offered a state funeral by the Victorian and Commonwealth governments. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, also announced the MCGs Great Southern Stand would be renamed the SK Warne Stand. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials had spoken to those travelling with Warne, and would arrive in Koh Samui later on Saturday. Dfat is working with Thai authorities to confirm arrangements following his passing, assist with his repatriation and provide other assistance on the ground, she said. Paying his own tribute to the Australia legend, Rolling Stones frontman, and avid cricket fan, Mick Jagger wrote on Twitter. Im so saddened by the sudden death of Shane Warne. He brought such joy to the game and was the greatest spin bowler ever. Warne leaves behind three children  Jackson, Brooke and Summer  from his 10-year marriage to Simone Callahan that ended in 2005.

Though the rise of the Twenty20 format came after his international career, he played in the Indian Premier League, captaining Rajasthan Royals to the title in 2008, and played five seasons for Hampshire in English county cricket between 2000 and 2007. But the figures also scarcely tell the story of a cricketer who transformed the art of leg-spin after making his Test debut against India aged 22 despite just seven first-class matches for Victoria. Though Warnes start was underwhelming, the following year he truly announced himself on the world stage when his first delivery in Ashes cricket  the Ball of the Century  bowled a bamboozled Englands Mike Gatting at Old Trafford. Warne went on to leave an indelible mark on the storied history of the rivalry between the two nations, playing a role in six successive Ashes series wins and then producing arguably his finest performance  40 wickets, despite off-field marriage problems  during the famous 2005 series that saw England end 16 years of Australian dominance. In 1998 it emerged that Warne and Mark Waugh had been fined four years earlier for providing information to an Indian bookmaker during Australias tour of Sri Lanka. But his darkest cricketing moment came when he was suspended from all cricket for 12 months before the start of the 2003 World Cup after testing positive for a diuretic. Bowing out from international cricket after the 2006-07 Ashes, the urn safely reclaimed with a 5-0 whitewash, Warne was one of the most astute tacticians in the game; the greatest captain Australia never had, went the oft-said phrase about a cricketing brain that always crackled with ideas and theories. This carried through to his post-playing days as a commentator for Sky in the UK and Fox Sports in Australia, so too the mischievous, larrikin character that generated headlines at both the front and back of newspapers and proved so popular with the sporting public. He was engaged to the actor Liz Hurley in 2010, a relationship that ended in 2013. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, was among those who paid tribute to Warne, saying: We have lost one of Australias greatest cricketers and today we are bewildered by this sad and sudden loss. Warnes family has been offered a state funeral by the Victorian and Commonwealth governments. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, also announced the MCGs Great Southern Stand would be renamed the SK Warne Stand. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials had spoken to those travelling with Warne, and would arrive in Koh Samui later on Saturday. Dfat is working with Thai authorities to confirm arrangements following his passing, assist with his repatriation and provide other assistance on the ground, she said. Paying his own tribute to the Australia legend, Rolling Stones frontman, and avid cricket fan, Mick Jagger wrote on Twitter. Im so saddened by the sudden death of Shane Warne. He brought such joy to the game and was the greatest spin bowler ever. Warne leaves behind three children  Jackson, Brooke and Summer  from his 10-year marriage to Simone Callahan that ended in 2005.

Shane Warne, the greatest leg-spinner in the history of cricket and an Australian icon who transcended the sport, has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 52. The news was confirmed by Warnes management company on Friday and released initially to Fox Sports, the network for whom he commentated after a playing career that returned 708 Test wickets from 145 caps between 1992 and 2007. A statement from MPC entertainment to the UK media said: It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack in Koh Samui, Thailand today, Friday 4 March. Shane was found unresponsive in his villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived. The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course. Coming just 24 hours after Australian cricket had lost former wicketkeeper Rod Marsh to a heart attack aged 74, news of Warnes passing left supporters, former teammates and opponents shocked and numb as tributes flowed on social media. Warne himself had paid tribute to Marsh. Members of the current Australia team learned of the news while travelling back from day one of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. David Warner, the opener, tweeted: Two legends of our game have left us too soon. Im lost for words, and this is extremely sad. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Marsh and Warne family. I just cannot believe it. rip, you will both be missed. Viv Richards, the former West Indies captain who like Warne was named one of Wisdens five cricketers of the 20th century, tweeted: Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This cant be true.

Though the rise of the Twenty20 format came after his international career, he played in the Indian Premier League, captaining Rajasthan Royals to the title in 2008, and played five seasons for Hampshire in English county cricket between 2000 and 2007. But the figures also scarcely tell the story of a cricketer who transformed the art of leg-spin after making his Test debut against India aged 22 despite just seven first-class matches for Victoria. Though Warnes start was underwhelming, the following year he truly announced himself on the world stage when his first delivery in Ashes cricket  the Ball of the Century  bowled a bamboozled Englands Mike Gatting at Old Trafford. Warne went on to leave an indelible mark on the storied history of the rivalry between the two nations, playing a role in six successive Ashes series wins and then producing arguably his finest performance  40 wickets, despite off-field marriage problems  during the famous 2005 series that saw England end 16 years of Australian dominance. In 1998 it emerged that Warne and Mark Waugh had been fined four years earlier for providing information to an Indian bookmaker during Australias tour of Sri Lanka. But his darkest cricketing moment came when he was suspended from all cricket for 12 months before the start of the 2003 World Cup after testing positive for a diuretic. Bowing out from international cricket after the 2006-07 Ashes, the urn safely reclaimed with a 5-0 whitewash, Warne was one of the most astute tacticians in the game; the greatest captain Australia never had, went the oft-said phrase about a cricketing brain that always crackled with ideas and theories. This carried through to his post-playing days as a commentator for Sky in the UK and Fox Sports in Australia, so too the mischievous, larrikin character that generated headlines at both the front and back of newspapers and proved so popular with the sporting public. He was engaged to the actor Liz Hurley in 2010, a relationship that ended in 2013. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, was among those who paid tribute to Warne, saying: We have lost one of Australias greatest cricketers and today we are bewildered by this sad and sudden loss. Warnes family has been offered a state funeral by the Victorian and Commonwealth governments. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, also announced the MCGs Great Southern Stand would be renamed the SK Warne Stand. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials had spoken to those travelling with Warne, and would arrive in Koh Samui later on Saturday. Dfat is working with Thai authorities to confirm arrangements following his passing, assist with his repatriation and provide other assistance on the ground, she said. Paying his own tribute to the Australia legend, Rolling Stones frontman, and avid cricket fan, Mick Jagger wrote on Twitter. Im so saddened by the sudden death of Shane Warne. He brought such joy to the game and was the greatest spin bowler ever. Warne leaves behind three children  Jackson, Brooke and Summer  from his 10-year marriage to Simone Callahan that ended in 2005.

Shane Warne, the greatest leg-spinner in the history of cricket and an Australian icon who transcended the sport, has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 52. The news was confirmed by Warnes management company on Friday and released initially to Fox Sports, the network for whom he commentated after a playing career that returned 708 Test wickets from 145 caps between 1992 and 2007. A statement from MPC entertainment to the UK media said: It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack in Koh Samui, Thailand today, Friday 4 March. Shane was found unresponsive in his villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived. The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course. Coming just 24 hours after Australian cricket had lost former wicketkeeper Rod Marsh to a heart attack aged 74, news of Warnes passing left supporters, former teammates and opponents shocked and numb as tributes flowed on social media. Warne himself had paid tribute to Marsh. Members of the current Australia team learned of the news while travelling back from day one of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. David Warner, the opener, tweeted: Two legends of our game have left us too soon. Im lost for words, and this is extremely sad. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Marsh and Warne family. I just cannot believe it. rip, you will both be missed. Viv Richards, the former West Indies captain who like Warne was named one of Wisdens five cricketers of the 20th century, tweeted: Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This cant be true.
